eodash is the software powering https://race.esa.int as well as
https://eodashboard.org

The [Rapid Action for citizens with Earth observation](https://race.esa.int)
presents the results of the Joint cooperation between
[ESA](https://www.esa.int/) and the
[European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en) to inform on societal global challenges using Earth Observations. The activity, initially called "Rapid Action for coronavirus EO" started in 2020, triggered by Covid-19 crisis and was expanded in scope in 2022. 

The [Earth Observing Dashboard](https://eodashboard.org) combines the resources,
technical knowledge and expertise of three partner agencies ESA, JAXA, and NASA
to strengthen our global understanding of global environmental changes and other societal challenges impacting our planet.

The platform demonstrates how the use of Earth observation data can help
shed new light on societal and economic changes currently taking place owing
to the coronavirus pandemic.
