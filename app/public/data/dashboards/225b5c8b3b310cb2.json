As the ocean water melts the ice shelf, the glacier's grounding line (the point where the glacier begins to float) retreats inland, allowing more ice to be exposed to the ocean and more ice to be lost through melting.\n\n- Calving, on the other hand, is the process by which large chunks of ice break off the ice shelf and fall into the ocean.

When calving occurs, the ice shelf loses mass and the glacier retreats.\n\nBoth these mechanisms are driven by warming ocean water, which is caused by changes in ocean circulation and an overall increase in ocean temperatures due to climate change.

      "text": "# How can satellites help monitor the Thwaites Glacier?\n\nSatellites are a powerful tool used to study the Thwaites Glacier as they provide a long-term view of the ice that is difficult to obtain through ground-based measurements. One of the primary ways satellites are used to measure ice is through the use of radar instruments, such as Copernicus Sentinel-1. This allows scientists to monitor the Thwaites Glacier and other ice sheets and glaciers in Antarctica more frequently and with greater detail than would be possible otherwise.\n\nThese instruments can penetrate through the surface of the ice and measure the ice's surface elevation. By comparing elevation measurements over time, scientists can determine whether the ice sheet or glacier is growing or shrinking. Satellites also provide essential information about ice dynamics such as ice velocity, which allows scientists to track ice movement and get information about how fast the ice is moving and calving.\n\nIn a [recent study](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Sentinel-1_and_AI_uncover_glacier_crevasses), scientists have developed new Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using radar images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite mission, to reveal how the Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue is being damaged by squeezing and stretching as it flows from the middle of the continent to the coast.\n\nThe research focused on a part of the glacier system where the ice flows into the sea and begins to float \u2013 the grounding line. It forms the start of the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf and the western Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue, which is also an ice shelf.  Sentinel-1\u2019s all-weather radar allows scientists to track ice movement and peer through snow cover to unveil Thwaites Glacier Tongue\u2019s crocodile skin-like appearance, which is normally hidden from sight.\nInteractive Sentinel-1 data displayed on a map over Thwaites Glacier, users can browse through the datasets on various dates.\n\nUsing machine learning, the researchers taught a computer to look at radar images from the Sentinel-1 mission and identify changes over the last decade. The analysis revealed that over the last six years, the Thwaites Glacier Ice Tongue has sped up and slowed down twice, by around 40% each time \u2013 from 4 km a year to 6 km a year before slowing. This is a substantial increase in the magnitude and frequency of speed change compared with past records.\nThis new use of artificial intelligence will allow scientists to more accurately monitor and model changes to this important glacier.\n\n### Explore the Sentinel-1 Observations of the Thwaites Glacier \nOn the map, you can browse the Sentinel-1 images acquired in [EW (extra wide swath) mode](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes/extra-wide-swath) over the Thwaites glacier from 2017 to 2021. The EW mode acquires data over a 400 km swath at 20 m by 40 m spatial resolution. The EW mode is aimed primarily for use over sea-ice, polar zones and certain maritime areas, in particular for ice, oil spill monitoring and security services. \n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<iframe width=\"649\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPjcl7rlIUM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nContains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2017\u20132019), processed by ESA.

One of these is the land beneath Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets. Buried under kilometres of ice is a fascinating network of waterways and lakes, where subsurface meltwater affects the speed with which the ice sheet flows towards the ocean.\nUsing a decade of altimetry data from [ESA\u2019s CryoSat satellite](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/CryoSat), scientists have discovered that the lakes beneath Thwaites, the largest of which is over 40 km long, [drained in quick succession](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/FutureEO/CryoSat/CryoSat_reveals_surprising_ebb_and_flow_of_subglacial_lakes), in 2013 and then in 2017. This kind of reoccurring drainage under Thwaites has never before been recorded. \n\nScientists estimate that the rate of drainage peaked at about 500 cubic metres a second \u2013 possibly the largest outflow of meltwater ever reported from subglacial lakes in this region. This peak rate is about eight times faster than the River Thames in England discharges on average to the North Sea.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, the scientists can see that the lakes recharged.\n\nLinking these observations with basal meltwater flowing into the lake through a network of basal channels, gave for the first time, an estimate of the rate of melting at the base of the ice sheet. By comparing these rates to modelled estimates, the scientists were able to demonstrate that models underestimate basal melting under this region of Thwaites by nearly 150%.\n\nThese findings will help to assess and constrain models and, in turn, improve the representation of the ice sheet system, and better project its evolution.\nWhat takes place under the ice sheet is critical in understanding how the glacier responds to changes in the atmosphere and ocean around Antarctica, and yet it is hidden from view making it difficult to observe. \n\nThis movement of water gives us a glimpse of where the water is and how much and how fast it moves across the system. Together this is key information about the nature of the subglacial environment and the processes of the hydrological network under the ice sheet. These findings provide key information that can help us project how the ice sheet adds to sea level as it responds to climate change.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<iframe width=\"649\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g783Y-ehXnA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPlanetary Visions (credit: ESA/Planetary Visions)\n</div>",
