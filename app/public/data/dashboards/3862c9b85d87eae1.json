      "text": "## Ocean Colour\n&nbsp;  \nOur planet is constantly changing. Some changes are fast \u2013 such as seasons and algae blooms \u2013  while others are slow and happen over decades to millennia. Some are caused by natural phenomena, while others, including global warming and ocean acidification, are caused by human activity.  Our planet\u2019s weather patterns and marked seasons make it necessary to collect data over long periods of time to see long-term changes over the normal seasonal variability. To do this, we have been using satellite sensors to collect a variety of measurements over the planet for more than two decades. \n\nOne of the most important processes in nature is primary productivity, which occurs when plants take the carbon in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere or water and use the energy from the sun to transform that carbon into living material. Primary productivity is at the base of our food chain and the key to life on Earth. \n\nMany things affect primary productivity in land and water. The crucial ingredients are sunlight, CO2, and nutrients. In the oceans, primary productivity is mostly controlled by the amount of sunlight and the availability of nutrients. We have measured how ocean primary productivity \u2013which produces oxygen for us to breathe, supports the oceanic food webs, and helps sequester atmospheric CO2 \u2013 has changed over the past 25 years. \n\nHowever, even with this long record, it is difficult to disentangle natural drivers of change from those induced by humans, such as climate change. Why is it so hard? The ocean and the atmosphere are connected, and some of the natural changes take place over decades. For example, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) \u2013 which causes cool and warm fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) \u2013 may last for 20-40 years. The El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a major phenomenon that takes place in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, can be as frequent as every 3 years, with variable intensity. These natural changes, or oscillations, affect SST, precipitation, and wind patterns, leading to changes in the water column and nutrients on which phytoplankton depend. Human activities, especially the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels, have also impacted global temperatures, which in turn impact ocean primary production. \n\nBut our ocean is vast and complex, which results in different amounts of primary productivity, a process important for the food we depend on and for atmospheric carbon sequestration. \n\nFor example, coastal areas, particularly those close to rivers, tend to have higher primary productivity due to nutrients coming in runoff from the land. The western coasts of continents, where wind and topography bring nutrient-rich deep water to the surface, also have high primary productivity. These areas are important for fisheries, particularly in  South America. In contrast, large areas of swirling ocean currents, known as gyres, (**Figure 1**) have low primary productivity and are considered biological deserts. A 16-year (1998-2013) analysis of trends in the five subtropical ocean gyres revealed warming and expansion of these ocean deserts, which means a decrease for the ability of our ocean to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere (Signorini et al. 2015, Leonelli et al, 2022).\n",

      "text": "Scientists study global trends in annual primary productivity because of their importance to ecosystems and human welfare. Satellite data, in combination with in situ measurements, and mathematical models to estimate primary productivity over the whole planet, allow us to take the pulse of our marine ecosystems. \n\n**Figure 2** shows the trends in annual primary production from different data sets. The first striking characteristic is the considerable variability across the ocean, reflecting its complexity. \n\nIn general, we see a decrease in net primary production in temperate oceanic regions in both the northern and southern hemispheres (up to -3%) and an increase at high latitudes (up to +4.5%). This doesn\u2019t sound like much, but over 24 years, these changes in net primary production are in the order of billions of pounds of carbon. \n\nOverall, the increases and decreases largely balance each other out; however, for organisms that depend on the primary production, local changes are the most important. \n\nThere is uncertainty in the direction, magnitude, and differences of changing primary productivity in shelf and coastal regions, which are affected by a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors. In addition, the trends observed are not all linear, meaning that they are not all changing at the same rate. \n\nGlobal primary productivity shows an increase in rates from 1998-2003 (Fig. 3), relatively stable rates 2003-2011, and a subsequent decrease in rates until 2015, after which rates showed a minor increase. This interannual variability appears to be strongly correlated to ocean-atmospheric connections: the initial increase in global annual primary production between 1998-2003 was related to ENSO and other ocean-atmosphere connections like the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), while the decrease in global annual primary production after 2011 was related to ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Kulk et al, 2021).\n\nLong-term climate records allow us to see how our planet is changing and can provide the necessary information to mitigate negative effects to our ecosystem and way of life. \n\n![](https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash/blob/staging/app/public/data/story-images/1-EO-Dashboard_Water_Story_Images_2.png?raw=true)\n\nFigure 3: Annual global primary production for each year in the period between 1998 and 2018 (from Kulk et al., 2021)",
