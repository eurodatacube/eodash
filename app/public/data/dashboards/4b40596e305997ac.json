      "text": "## What We Monitor \n&nbsp;  \nWith the help of satellites, we are able to monitor crops throughout the growing seasons and can use a combination of satellite derived time series to quantify critical indicators related to crop health for a specific region and crop over time. One such example of satellite-derived products are the GEOGLAM-NASA Harvest Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observation Indicators, which are supported by the global remote sensing community and updated every 7-12 days to ensure that users are provided with the most up to date information. Displaying climate, environmental, and vegetative variables that impact agricultural outcomes, the AGMET Indicators were born from an agricultural stakeholder-identified need for a simple way to visualize and frequently monitor crop health with the ultimate goal of identifying potential cropping concerns as the growing season progresses and before a food shortage materializes. Satellite data provides a wealth of information to meet these needs including:\n\n\n### Agromet parameters\n\n**(1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A measure of crop health**\n&nbsp;  \nShowing global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation. As a crop season progresses, NDVI values will increase during early crop growth and development of leafy vegetation, will reach the peak as the crop fully develops and reaches maturity (before senescence), and then will decrease again as the crop matures and as the leafy vegetation begins to die off. How the NDVI values progress over the course of the season and the individual peak values can help predict the productivity of the crops and be compared to previous seasons.\n\n**(2) Surface soil moisture: A measure of water stored in the ground and available to crops**\n&nbsp;  \nLike NDVI, surface soil moisture is a key component for crop production that can be measured using satellite data (such as ESA\u2019s SMOS instrument, JAXA\u2019s GCOM-W instrument and NASA\u2019s SMAP instrument). The amount of moisture in the soil will depend on meteorological conditions that can also be measured with the help of satellite data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) as well as sun exposure, wind, runoff/drainage, and soil type. If there is less water in the soil, it will be more difficult for crop roots to take up that water, resulting in a crop that is under greater stress. If the stress continues, the crop will wilt and eventually die. However, if the soil is above field capacity and the pores are oversaturated with water, then oxygen levels are restricted and it can be detrimental for the crop. This is why soil moisture is a key indicator of what may ultimately be a successful or failed crop.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of measurements that satellite missions can provide, but just as important as the information itself is how we analyze it and apply it. Because of the global coverage, frequent revisit rate, and repeatability of satellite data, we are able to successfully explore food security questions, climate change affects, and agricultural production around the world.

This not only impacts Brazil and the global market, but also the countries that rely on the region for their food/feed imports. Earth observations can give an early indication of threats to food security should supplies end up being less than needed. Another benefit of remotely sensed satellite data is that these types of evaluations can be done anywhere in the world throughout the season.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/data/story-images/NASAHarvest-GEOGLAM-Brazil.png?raw=true\" alt>\nSouth Region (Brazil) Spring-planted Maize 2022</p>\n<h3>Dry Conditions in Southern Brazil</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;  </p>\n<h4>b)    JAXA JASMIN/Japan JASMAI with MAFF</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>Accumulated and anormal precipitation information derived from GSMaP by JASMIN/JASMAI on this March is shown in following because  in Southern Brazil crops did not receive the expected amount of precipitation, which negatively impacted yields of the spring planted crop.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Precipitation by GSMap</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Precipitation Anomaly by GSMaP</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"/data/story-images/Precipitation%20by%20GSMaP.png\" alt></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"/data/story-images/Precipitation%20anomaly%20by%20GSMaP.png\" alt></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td align=\"center\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The following time series reflect the precipitation, soil moisture and NDVI variables from JASMIN/JASMAI for Estado de Paran\u00e1: \n&nbsp;  </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Precipitation</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Soil Moisture</th>\n<th align=\"center\">NDVI</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"/data/story-images/Parana%20Precipitation.png\" alt></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"/data/story-images/Parana%20Soil%20Moisture.png\" alt></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"/data/story-images/Parana%20Precipitation.png\" alt></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n"
