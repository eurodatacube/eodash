One such example of satellite-derived products are the GEOGLAM-NASA Harvest Agrometeorological (AGMET) Earth Observation Indicators, which are supported by the global remote sensing community and updated every 7-12 days to ensure that users are provided with the most up to date information. Displaying climate, environmental, and vegetative variables that impact agricultural outcomes, the AGMET Indicators were born from an agricultural stakeholder-identified need for a simple way to visualize and frequently monitor crop health with the ultimate goal of identifying potential cropping concerns as the growing season progresses and before a food shortage materializes. Satellite data provides a wealth of information to meet these needs including:\n\n\n### Agromet parameters\n\n**(1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): A measure of crop health**\n&nbsp;  \nShowing global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being observed contains live green vegetation. As a crop season progresses, NDVI values will increase during early crop growth and development of leafy vegetation, will reach the peak as the crop fully develops and reaches maturity (before senescence), and then will decrease again as the crop matures and as the leafy vegetation begins to die off. How the NDVI values progress over the course of the season and the individual peak values can help predict the productivity of the crops and be compared to previous seasons.\n\n**(2) Surface soil moisture: A measure of water stored in the ground and available to crops**\n&nbsp;  \nLike NDVI, surface soil moisture is a key component for crop production that can be measured using satellite data (such as ESA\u2019s SMOS instrument, JAXA\u2019s GCOM-W instrument and NASA\u2019s SMAP instrument). The amount of moisture in the soil will depend on meteorological conditions that can also be measured with the help of satellite data (precipitation, temperature, etc.) as well as sun exposure, wind, runoff/drainage, and soil type. If there is less water in the soil, it will be more difficult for crop roots to take up that water, resulting in a crop that is under greater stress. If the stress continues, the crop will wilt and eventually die. However, if the soil is above field capacity and the pores are oversaturated with water, then oxygen levels are restricted and it can be detrimental for the crop. This is why soil moisture is a key indicator of what may ultimately be a successful or failed crop.",
