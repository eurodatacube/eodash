Carbon dioxide is consumed during photosynthesis, and the carbon is incorporated in the phytoplankton, just as carbon is stored in the leaves of a tree on land. This is called primary productivity, and much like on land, in the ocean and inland waters it is fundamental to feeding other organisms, and generating most of the oxygen we breathe. \n\nHowever, there are different types of phytoplankton, and some can be less beneficial for the ecosystem than others. Many people who live along the coast are familiar with harmful algal blooms (HAB), also known as red tides. These dangerous conditions occur when certain species of phytoplankton increase rapidly, resulting in damaging effects to other organisms. For example, they can suffocate marine life when they grow too fast.

For example, Florida experiences HABs in its coastal waters and in inland lakes, such as Lake Okeechobee. HAB outbreaks are now even happening in the Arctic, because of warming ocean conditions.
