Sea ice freeboard is the amount of sea ice and snow cover that is visible above the surface of the ocean and, along with snow depth, is a critical measurement for accurately measuring the thickness of sea ice in the polar oceans. Click here to learn more about this research.\n \nNASA\u2019s ICESat-2 mission has been measuring the height of the Earth\u2019s features from space with a laser ever since its launch in September 2018. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) onboard ICESat-2 shoots pulses of light towards the Earth\u2019s surface. ATLAS counts the particles of light (i.e., photons) that bounce off the Earth\u2019s surface and return to the instrument\u2019s sensors, measuring the round-trip time of each photon with extreme accuracy. Scientists can then take the total elapsed time to generate a height measurement of the particular surface that each photon bounced from. When enough photon measurements have been collected, scientists clump these measurements together to form a \u201cphoton cloud\u201d that produces continuous surface elevation measurements as the satellite collects more and more data along its orbit. ICESat-2 collects data over the same location every 91 days, and this allows scientists to develop a picture of how the heights at certain spots around the globe are changing over time.\n \nCollecting repeated height measurements of the Earth\u2019s ice from space is an important way to view changes happening over the course of seasons and years. While ICESat-2 can only measure the height of Earth\u2019s ice, scientists utilize special formulas (based on Archimedes' principle) to take those height measurements and turn them into measurements of sea ice freeboard that includes the ice above and below the waterline.\n \n",

      "text": " ESA has been building radar altimeters since the early 1990s. Radar altimeters use a microwave signal to measure sea ice freeboard. In this frequency band, the signal can penetrate further into the snow that often lies on top of sea ice. To better understand how far the radar signals can penetrate the snowpack, separate field or airborne campaigns are needed to validate the satellite signals. Ongoing research is comparing altimeter signals at different frequencies to calculate how much snow lies on top of the sea ice. This is important as the amount of snow can also impact the freeboard\u2014for instance a heavy snow-load can weigh the sea ice down and may even push it under water.\n \nOnce the freeboard has been established, it can be converted to sea ice thickness.
