Productivity in tropical water is low throughout the year due to warm and highly stratified surface water that prevents the nutrient-rich deep waters from reaching the surface. \n\nAt mid-latitudes, a seasonal cycle is observed, with the lowest productivity in winter due to light scarcity, followed in spring by productivity blooms due to the combination of light and well mixed, nutrient-rich water. In the summer, productivity declines despite strong light availability, due to increased stratification and nutrient depletion by the spring/early summer phytoplankton blooms. \n\nAt high latitudes, stratification is weak year-round, but scarcity or absence of light in winter/autumn leads to lower levels of productivity.
