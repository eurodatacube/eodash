Researchers mapping the bedrock have discovered Thwaites Glacier is particularly vulnerable to marine ice-sheet instability because its grounding line (the area of a grounded glacier or ice sheet that meets a floating ice shelf or glacier tongue) is deep below sea level and largely influenced by ocean-driven melting rates happening at the bottom of the glacier. Its bedrock topography recedes into kilometer-deep troughs, which means if the glacier thins enough for the grounded ice to start floating, the grounding line would retreat farther into the ice sheet interior, exposing more ice to ocean-induced melt. Since the ice is thicker inland, grounding line retreat would also result in more ice being transported each year from the grounded ice sheet interior to the ocean, contributing to accelerated sea-level contribution.

Measurements of the bedrock\u2019s topography, typically taken by ground and airborne radar, are sparse, resulting in bedrock maps that are too imprecise for the model to make sufficiently accurate predictions. To be accurate enough to capture all the bedrock features that could impact glacier retreat, future measurements will need a horizontal resolution of about 1.25 miles (two kilometers), meaning measurement points on a \u201cgrid\u201d over the surface would need to be separated by no more than two kilometers.
