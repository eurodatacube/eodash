      "text": "# Anthropogenic Over-Use as a driving force behind lake shrinkage\nThe Aral Sea, which was one of the world\u2019s largest inland bodies of water located between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, has lost over 90% of its original size which was believed to due to excessive irrigation for cotton farming and other human activities, resulting in devastating environmental, economic, and health consequences for the region. \n\nA study from 2007, pointed another cause as the diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers away from the sea (one of the irrigation strategies of the former Soviet Union) that led to the loss of 90 % of its fish species and over 250 species of plankton.\n\nHowever, a recent study which analysed the Aral Sea Basin (ASB) found that while the expansion of cropland was previously believed to be the primary cause of of the sea\u2019s shrinkage, it actually ceased in 2000, meaning that the expansion of cropland is no longer the main factor driving ASB shrinkage. This long-term study found that the hydrological cycle in the ASB has intensified through a spatial and temporal scale approach based on Earth observation.  Specifically, the Aral Sea basin experienced a significant increase of the annual total actual evapotranspiration (AET) of 10,13% from 1980 to 2019. The ASB plain area saw a significant rise in the total annual AET by 37.81% which nearly depleted the water that should have flowed into the Aral sea. This increase in AET contributed to the shrinkage of the Aral sea, highlighting the importance of reducing evapotranspiration and minimising unproductive water losses to protect the sea.\n\nAs a result of its drastic shrinking, the Aral Sea has also suffered ecological degradation with social and economic impacts. \n\nOne of the main consequences, after it\u2019s shrinkage, led to a rise of concentration of salts and minerals of the water. That change in chemistry has led to staggering alterations in the lake\u2019s ecology causing significant drops in the Aral Sea\u2019s fish population.\nBesides the loss of habitat and changes in water quality caused by the increase of salt and other pollutants in the remaining water, the exposure of the lakebed has also resulted in the release of toxic dust particles leading to health issues for local residents. Strong winds that blow in this area routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons on now exposed soil every year. This process has not only contributed to to significant reduction in breathable air quality for nearby habitants, but has also appreciably affected crop yields due to those heavily salt-laden particles falling on arable land.\n\nToday its decline serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the need for sustainable water management practices and international cooperation. The long-term sustainability and stability of the Aral Sea\u2019s ecosystem remains uncertain. The sea has experienced significant ecological shifts and irreversible damage over the years, and it may have crossed tipping points in some aspects. Efforts have been to mitigate the damage caused by the Aral sea crisis, including the construction of dams to restore water levels and improve its ecological health.",
