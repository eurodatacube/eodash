It is common knowledge that we find ice at the Earth\u2019s poles. In the south lies Antarctica, a large landmass covered by kilometers of ice. But at the North Pole, there is no land. The ice is frozen ocean water. For more than forty years, scientists have been monitoring Arctic sea ice extent with satellites from space.\n \nThe extent of sea ice cover (and its thickness) in the Arctic Ocean is declining annually because more of the Arctic Ocean is ice-free longer throughout the year. Decreasing sea ice in the Arctic has widespread consequences, including impacting marine habitats for wildlife, changing global shipping routes, increasing traffic in previously undisturbed waterways, and affecting local weather patterns. This loss of frozen ocean cover is changing the energy balance of the world\u2019s oceans by increasing the amount of solar radiation absorbed by a darker ocean surface, which leads to additional warming of the ocean and continued melting of sea ice. Scientists across the world are monitoring this activity because of its effect on the entire planet. \n \nHowever, this icy cover is not uniform in thickness. It may only be a few centimeters thin with barely the strength to support any weight, or it may be up to 2 meters thick in places. Thicker ice remains year-round and is termed multi-year ice. In contrast, ice that is only tens of centimeters thin melts and freezes with the seasons. Sea ice is a three-dimensional layer of thick and thin slabs of ice that dynamically move around on top of the world\u2019s polar oceans surrounding the North Pole and the Antarctic continent. \n \nNASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) present separate but integrated stories to show how data from satellites and instruments are used to enhance the scientific understanding of how sea ice in the Arctic is changing seasonally and annually.\n",
