      "text": "Spaceborne satellite missions will soon provide globally consistent measurements of forests that can be used to estimate biomass.  However, different space missions using different sensors and technologies (e.g., radar, lidar) often produce different estimates of biomass. Such disparities are a potential source of confusion, so it is highly desirable to produce a single most accurate biomass dataset by combining the strengths of the individual sensors.\n\nThe world\u2019s Earth observation biomass community is undertaking a collaboration aimed at resolving discrepancies between space missions and producing harmonized estimates of biomass and uncertainty at a policy-relevant, jurisdictional-level scale. \n\n\n![](/data/story-images/Biomass_Figure1.png)\n\n\n## Existing Biomass Products\n&nbsp;  \nSeveral current projects are producing continental- to global-scale biomass maps. These include: \n\n- [ESA\u2019s CCI-Biomass global maps](https://climate.esa.int/en/projects/biomass/) at a scale of 100 meters for the years 2010, 2017, 2018, and 2020; \n\n- [JPL\u2019s global 100 meter map](https://ceos.org/gst/jpl-biomass.html) for 2020 and a time series of 10 kilometer biomass maps from 2000 through 2020; \n\n- NASA GEDI\u2019s 1 kilometer map for 2020 covering latitudes between approximately 52\u00b0 N and 52\u00b0 S; \n\n- NASA\u2019s ICESat-2 30 meter boreal map for 2020; and\n\n- The UK National Centre for Earth Observation (EO) 100 meter time series of maps for Africa from 2007 to 2017.\n\nKey global biomass production and validation teams, including national experts, are engaged in this effort. These teams share the goal of producing harmonized biomass products for use in the UNFCCC Global Stocktake process.\n\n## Explore Datasets \nThe map illustrates the NCEO Africa Aboveground Woody Biomass (AGB) map for the year 2017 at 100 m spatial resolution which was developed using a combination of LiDAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical based data.
