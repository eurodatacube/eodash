The darker shades are places with less light while the lighter shades of yellow are areas with more light.\n\nThe Port of Dunkirk is the third-largest maritime port in northern France. Located on the busy North Sea, the port is well known for the comings and goings of heavy cargo barges. In early March, following French government guidance, the port began to limit activity in response to the novel coronavirus. \n\nResearchers are using night lights to track variations in energy use, migration, and transportation at the port in response to social distancing and lockdown measures. \n\nThey are able to visualize the extent social distancing measures impacted various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.\n\n![](https://www.cruisemapper.com/images/ports/9901-841799c4b49.jpg)\n*Port of Dunkirk.

The nightlights data, captured before and during the mandate, show an abrupt decrease in night lights predominantly in the central business districts, market areas, and entertainment districts that can be seen in the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d imagery.\n\nHigh-resolution nighttime images from space, referred to by NASA as the Black Marble HD dataset, provide data on how coronavirus-containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods. The nightlights sensor can decipher changes in urban business, industry, and transportation activity patterns associated with closures, event cancellations, and reduced vehicle traffic.",

The high-resolution nighttime images from space, referred to by NASA as the Black Marble HD dataset, is processed to eliminate light sources like moonlight reflectance and other interferences. Furthermore, before assuming the direct link between decrease of lights and COVID-19-related restrictions it is always important to discard other potential factors for change. Nevertheless, this data can shed a light (pun intended) on how coronavirus-containment strategies have affected local businesses and neighborhoods, deciphering changes in urban business, industry, and transportation activity patterns associated with closures, event cancellations, and reduced vehicle traffic by night.",
