In spring (April-May), the phytoplankton bloom comes later in colder years, earlier in warmer years. The relationship between the bloom period and the growth period of predators may have an impact on higher-level ecosystems which are also used as marine resources.\n\nSatellite sensors that observe ocean color help us estimate the spatial distribution and temporal changes in phytoplankton mass, their productivity and ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and related environmental variables that impact ecosystem health. Satellites provide important information to adequately carry out ecosystem-based management for sustainable use of the marine biological resources.\n\n### References\n[1] IOCCG (2009).
