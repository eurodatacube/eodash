These nutrients can enter waterways from point sources such as agriculture or industrial and wastewater treatment plants discharge. Runoff from urban and farmland areas from nutrient-enriched rainfall are additional sources. When there is an overabundance of these nutrients in a lake, eutrophication occurs. Excess of nutrients can cause algal blooms, which can lead to a tipping point where the algae consume oxygen and block sunlight for underwater plants. \n \nExcess nitrogen input from agricultural practices is often the main cause of increased algae growth. However, for Lake V\u00e4nern, the largest lake in Sweden and the third-largest lake in Europe, changes in water temperature have been identified as the biggest contributor to the growth of algae [2, 3], together with changes in precipitation patterns [4,5] and lake ice cover, particularly during the warm and dry seasons.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash/blob/master/app/public/data/story-images/Eodashboard_lakevanern_2307112.png?raw=true\" width=\"300\">\n \nA study concluded that total phytoplankton biomass has significantly increased since the 1980s at the same time as total phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen concentrations have significantly decreased [4]. These findings showed that decreasing acidity in combination with increasing water temperatures played a bigger role for phytoplankton growth than nutrient concentrations. This suggested that phytoplankton biomass in oligotrophic small and large lakes is strongly associated with climate and atmospheric depositional change, and that temperature change affects not only phytoplankton growth but also its composition [6].\n \nWarmer winters are also causing an earlier break-up of lake ice, which can lead to an earlier occurrence of the spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake V\u00e4nern [7]. As winters in Sweden have become warmer since the 1990s, the timing of ice break-up and the growth and decline of spring phytoplankton have shifted to start earlier.  This spring-ward shift in phytoplankton population growth resulted in an extension of the growing season by at least one month [7].\n \nNevertheless, the nutrients are still a contributing factor to the occurrence of algae blooms in this lake. Changes [2] in precipitation patterns have influenced the lake\u2019s water level and nutrient inputs [8] which can affect the growth of algae. As precipitation will generally increase mostly in the west part of Sweden and during the winter season, flooding on the watercourse in west and southwest Sweden can lead to increased nutrient inputs in Lake V\u00e4nern [5]. \n \nMoreover, the intense algae or cyanobacteria blooms have impacted drinking water production, irrigation and recreation in V\u00e4nern [4].
