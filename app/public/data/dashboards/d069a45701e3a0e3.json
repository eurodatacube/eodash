In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).\n\nTotal Suspended Matter (TSM) i.e, the concentration of organic and inorganic materials suspended in the water, is another proxy for water quality as different contaminants, including nutrients, trace metals, semi-volatile organic compounds, and numerous pesticides, can aggregate to these solids and brought in suspension. This can alter the state of the aquatic ecosystem and the use of freshwater resources. For instance, excessive suspended material might condition primary productivity. TSM concentration can be very high near the coasts due to the resuspension of terrestrial or submarine particulate matter by tides, waves, and currents.\n\n\n### Water Quality Maps\n\nThe displayed maps show weekly Chl concentration anomalies (%) and weekly Total Suspended Matter concentration anomalies (%) for the North Adriatic Sea, the Mediterranean sub-basin most influenced by river runoff, in particular by the Po River, which is the largest river in Italy and which runs along many different industrialized areas. Moreover, the North Adriatic coastline is a very popular tourist destination. In particular, the displayed area includes Venice, one of the most touristic destinations in the world, whose frequentation totally stopped during the lockdown.\n\n### Example of the impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality\n\nDespite existing differences in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of the three optical sensors, as well as in the algorithms used to calculate the Chl concentration, all three sensors highlight a general, negative trend of Chl concentration anomaly in the Venice Lagoon as well as offshore the whole Po River coastal zone during the Italian lockdown.\nIn the Venice lagoon, this pattern of low Chlorophyll concentration can be most probably linked to the decrease of maritime traffic and tourism frequentation, as highlighted by high resolution Sentinel-2 images available in the area (Fig. 1). \n\n\n![](data/trilateral/WQ_Figure1.png)\n\n*Figure 1. S2-derived true-colour images (left panels) and turbidity maps (right panels) in the lagoon of Venice on February 20th (Pre-COVID-19) and March 19th (COVID-19).*\n\n\nOffshore the lagoon, this striking negative trend is likely due to remarkably well-stratified thermohaline conditions, which maintained values of Chl concentration fairy low and hindered alongshore transport of riverine loads in the northern sector of the basin. These well-stratified conditions, clearly exemplified by the observed increase in Sea Surface Temperature (Fig. 2) as measured by a multi-sensor product (including data from NOAA-18, MetOpA-B, Aqua, Terra, MSG1, NPP, Meteosat11, Sentinel 3A-B), resulted from the particular interplay between low and warm Po River runoff and low wind intensities. \n\n![](data/trilateral/WQ_Figure2.png)\n\n*Figure 2. Mean Sea Surface Temperature for the weeks March, 25th – March, 31st (left plot), April, 1st – April, 8th (central plot) and April, 8th- April, 14th (right plot)*\n\nHowever, despite the clear role of natural environmental factors, we cannot exclude a mutual role of a decrease in human activities over the Po River watershed, which enhanced the negative anomaly in Chl concentration, as highlighted by the low turbidity values in the lower branch of Po River, measured by Sentinel-2 during the lockdown phase (Fig. 3).\n\n![](data/trilateral/WQ_Figure3.png)\n\n*Figure 3.

Many ports are closed, shipments have been canceled, and, in some locations, altered shipping routes have prevented the efficient movement of cargo. \n\nNASA and ESA researchers are using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology and high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs and [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) to track shipping activity at major ports in the U.S. and in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic. This data will help quantify the level of shipping-related economic activity over time and could eventually contribute to our understanding of the environmental implications of global decreases in shipping on key air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2).\n\n### Detection of ships on PlanetScope images\n\nNASA’s Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT), based at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, trained an algorithm using supervised machine learning technique to detect ships on PlanetScope images. The algorithm detects a ship on the image and geolocates it. The NASA team has also built an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows ship detections to be aggregated across a port area for a given day. Efforts are also underway to conduct a study of ship detections in U.S. ports during the period of pandemic travel restrictions, as compared to the same period of time in previous years. \n\nNASA researchers have access to the high-resolution imagery from Planet Labs, through the Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Program (CSDAP), which acquires data from commercial sources that support NASA's Earth science research goals. The PlanetScope image resolution is 3 meters per pixel, which allows researchers to get a detailed look at changes occurring on the ground. Commercial small satellites also provide high temporal resolution, making images available almost every day (depending on cloud cover) for key areas of interest. \n\nShip detections will be provided daily, except when prevented by significant cloud cover. After the machine learning model detects the ships, a secondary human validation is also performed before the detections are made available for the dashboard. \n\n### Detection of ships on Sentinel-2 images\n\nESA engineers based at ESA's [Centre for Earth Observation (ESRIN)](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN) trained a Machine Learning algorithm to recognise ships on  Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images. Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution (10 meters) multi-spectral imagery for land services. It provides for example, imagery of vegetation, soil and water cover, inland waterways and coastal areas. Sentinel-2 also delivers information for emergency services. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission comprises a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites and has a high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes). \n\nTo reduce the number of false alarms and mis-detections, a cloud-masking operation is performed on the images before the Machine Learning algorithm is applied. The outputs of the Machine Learning algorithm are bounding boxes of the detected ships within pre-defined areas of interest at major European harbours, such as Genova in Italy or Hamburg in Germany. \n",
