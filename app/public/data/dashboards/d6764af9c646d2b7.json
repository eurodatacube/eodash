Evapotranspiration is the combined process by which water moves from Earth\u2019s surface into the atmosphere through evaporation or transpiration [1]. This can contribute directly to the decrease of waterbodies' extents and levels.\n\nOne example of this is the Colorado River, located in the southwest United States and northwest Mexico. This 2330 km-long river passes through arid regions on the west slope of the Rocky Mountains, and is a source of drinking water, irrigation and electricity for more than 40 million people and 5 million acres of farmland [2].

The cause is not clear, but it is believed to have been caused by natural climate variability. However, the current drought is largely driven by anthropogenic climate change.

An example is the Tonl\u00e9 Sap Lake in Cambodia - one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world and the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia [1]. Every year during the monsoon season, the Mekong river floods and reverses the flow of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap, replenishing the lake and fish stock [2]. However, changes in precipitation patterns and manmade infrastructures have led to irregular and unpredictable water flows, impacting the lake's seasonal flood patterns [1,3,4]. \n\nWater levels in Tonl\u00e9 Sap hit historic lows for the third year in a row in 2021 [2]. Moreover, the construction of dams and hydropower projects in the upstream areas of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap basin has altered the natural water flow and sedimentation patterns in the lake [2,4]. In addition to climate change, large-scale dams are disrupting the timing and size of floods during the wet seasons, which are critical to sustaining the health of the Tonl\u00e9 Sap and the Mekong basin and maintaining the livelihoods of millions of people. In fact, this lake is also at a tipping point, as it faces the imminent risk of ecological collapse due to the combination of threats from dams and climate change [5]. \n\nIn addition, recent studies have shown that water level changes in the Mekong River due to dams are likely to have dramatic effects on the Tonl\u00e9 Sap water level, greatly affecting the ecosystem. Relatively small rises in the lake's water level would permanently inundate disproportionately large areas of floodplain, leaving them inaccessible to floodplain vegetation and eroding the productivity basis of the ecosystem [7]. The water changes in water discharge from the Mekong River have also been affecting the inflow of sediments, nutrients and migratory aquatic animals, which are essential to the ecosystem [8]. In fact, in 2019, a combination of climate change, El Nino, and dams on the Mekong resulted in the Tonl\u00e9 Sap River flowing backwards for weeks (rather than months) leaving the lake\u2019s water warm, shallow and oxygen-deprived, which eventually led to the a decline of 80-90% of fisheries [9].\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2015/05/cambodian_rivers/15398170-1-eng-GB/Cambodian_rivers_pillars.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"1000\">\n  <p>\nFlooded landscape in Cambodia between the Mekong River (right) and Tonl\u00e9 Sap river (left) pictured by Japan\u2019s ALOS satellite, CC JAXA/ESA</p>\n</div>\n\n",

More than 100,000 lakes are at risk of having ice-free winters if air temperatures increase by 4\u00b0C [2]. While the probability of having an ice-free winter has risen dramatically for lakes around the world, those in more southern and coastal regions are especially vulnerable due to higher average winter temperatures [3].\n \nLake Balaton, located in Hungary, is the largest lake in central Europe. Known for its ice cover during winter months, the lake has been experiencing a decrease in the duration and thickness of ice cover in recent decades compared to historical records [4]. A study investigated the tipping points of winter ice cover lakes across North America. The research identified critical temperature thresholds at which ice cover transitions from stable to unstable conditions. The authors found that in general, shallow and deep lakes (where winter air temperatures are around 0\u00b0C) and large, deep lakes in colder regions are particularly sensitive to losing ice cover [5]. Many lakes in the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing the shortest seasons of ice cover ever recorded,  and identified Lake Superior (the largest of the Great Lakes of North America) as one of the fastest warming lakes in the world [6].\n \nThe reduction in ice cover, which results from warming air temperatures [1] [4], has significant implications for the local ecosystem and economy as it affects the lake\u2019s hydrodynamics, water quality as well as recreational activities. Also, Lake Balaton had a record-setting algal bloom in 2019, which studies have concluded to be an effect of climate change-induced changes [7]. Long-term time series of freshwater ice have a potential resource for (paleo)climatological research due to the strong link between water and air temperature and freshwater phenomena [4]. The timing of ice melting and water level peaks can have significant impacts for various sectors, including energy production [8]. This sector relies on predictable water supply, and therefore the timing of ice melt and water peaks is crucial for forecasting energy production. Changes in timing can disrupt water resource management, potentially leading to challenges in energy generation or water availability for irrigation [8]. Understanding tipping points and their implications for ice cover loss is crucial for managing water resources, preserving ecosystems and anticipating the impacts across several sectors that depend on these inland water bodies. \n\n\n### Map\nThe map on the right shows a comparison of the lake surface temperature of lake Balaton (Hungary) for 2010 and 2020.",
