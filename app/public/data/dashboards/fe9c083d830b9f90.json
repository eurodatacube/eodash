The city is located on the fertile floodplain of the Nile River and is surrounded by farmland, with a high concentration of farmland to the north. The farmland stands out in satellite imagery against the drier deserts of Egypt, and during the growing season crops absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be measured from space. \n\nThe following maps show examples of the changes of atmospheric CO2 concentrations based on the growth and photosynthetic activity of crops on nearby farms.\n\nWe can observe the emission of CO2 from cars, power plants, and other fossil-fuel burning activities from space using the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s Greenhouse gasses Observing Satellite (GOSAT). We can also observe how crops on surrounding farmlands consume CO2 by looking at solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF).
