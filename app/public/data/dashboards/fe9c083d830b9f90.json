The city is located on the fertile floodplain of the Nile River and is surrounded by farmland, with a high concentration of farmland to the north. The farmland stands out in satellite imagery against the drier deserts of Egypt, and during the growing season crops absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be measured from space. \n\nThe following maps show examples of the changes of atmospheric CO2 concentrations based on the growth and photosynthetic activity of crops on nearby farms.\n\nWe can observe the emission of CO2 from cars, power plants, and other fossil-fuel burning activities from space using the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s Greenhouse gasses Observing Satellite (GOSAT). We can also observe how crops on surrounding farmlands consume CO2 by looking at solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). SIF is an innovative measurement that serves as a proxy of plant photosynthetic activity. Crops and other plants absorb white light from the sun and when photosynthesis occurs, they emit some of the unused energy from the sun as a red glow, known as SIF. \n \nBy combining GOSAT data, TROPOMI SIF data, surface wind data, and a statistical megacity emission inventory, we can monitor daily atmospheric changes of CO2. GOSAT observes tropospheric partial column density of carbon dioxide (CO2) over global megacities and provides the CO2 enhancement from lower atmosphere (0-4 km) density minus upper atmosphere (4-12 km) density. \n\nIn this research, researchers from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency demonstrate how CO2 levels over Cairo change over time based on trends in combustion, SIF levels, and wind direction.\n \nEgypt has two growing seasons, one in the summer and one in the winter.
