GOSAT observes tropospheric partial column density of carbon dioxide (CO2) over global megacities by agile target pointing. GOSAT provides the CO2 enhancement from lower atmosphere (0-4 km) density minus upper atmosphere (4-12 km) density. TROPOMI observes nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column density and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). CO2 and NO2 are correlated with emissions from high temperature fossil fuel combustion. CO2 and SIF are correlated with carbon uptake by plant photosynthetic activity. These data tell us daily atmospheric changes by travelling on surface wind.

Cairo is the most populated city in Africa, with approximately 40 km square of the urban area, surrounded by desert isolated from external large emissions. GOSAT observations of lower tropospheric CO2 enhancement covers the Cairo urban area by almost 4-by-4 aligned soundings of a 10-km footprint. \n\nMeanwhile, TROPOMI NO2 and SIF observations are extracted to about 200 km area around Cairo. CO2 and NO2 over Cairo urban area, and SIF intensity of Nile Delta are strongly correlated with surface wind direction measured at Cairo International Airport. Cairo is an interesting city type for understanding of CO2 change affected by southern city emission and northern cropping uptake. Egypt is the host country of COP27, 2022 to discuss on climate change measures. Typical atmospheric daily stories are shown.
