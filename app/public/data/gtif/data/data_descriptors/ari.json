 Product description: The Aggregate Risk Index (ARI) is an index that provides a
measure of the health outcome-specific risk due to the short-term exposure to multiple air
pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3). It is derived by additively summing the
product of pollutant concentration weighted using health outcome-specific Relative Risk
factors of increased mortality due to all causes, provided by the World Health
Organization.
