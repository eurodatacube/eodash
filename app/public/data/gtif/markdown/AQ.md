Click on a bin on the map to display a scatterplot of your currently selected parameter against Sentinel-5p measurements.
### Disclaimer
The aggregation on S5-p based bins of different datasets is a prototype to incentivise the exploration of satellite based data with other collected datasets with the posssible goal of finding some correlation. This is a demonstrator on how to integrate and compare data on the same grid, further validation is needed for this approach to be able to allow meaningful conclusions.
Please also note that the provided estimates for Number of trajectories, Congestion index, Speed, Motorized count, and Motorized share may not be entirely accurate, mainly due to the collection mechanisms of the data used to generate the estimates.
