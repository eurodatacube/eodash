### Human Mobility Patterns

#### Congestion index

**Brief description:** The Congestion index represents the per cent decrease of the hourly average speed observed on the street with respect to the median speed observed during the trimester on that road which is considered the reference speed in normal conditions. Large values (i.e., a congestion index larger than ~30) highlight street congestion (that is, trips feature a lower average speed with respect to the ideal case) while smaller values indicate an ideal travel situation.

**Unit:** percentage

**Value Range:** 0 - 100 [%];

**Color Range:** linear scale [0 - 100]
