#### Congestion index

**Brief description:** The Congestion index represents the ratio between the Real Trip Duration
and Traffic-free Trip Duration, with values greater than 1 indicating congestion (trips that take
more time to be completed with respect to the ideal case) and values close to or less than 1
indicating an ideal travel situation.

**Unit:** dimensionless

**Value Range:** 0.5 - 3;

**Color Range:** linear scale [0.5, 3]
