### Human Mobility Patterns

#### Motorized trip share index

**Brief description:** The Motorized trip share index displays the daily percentage of trajectories traversing a street segment that is deemed to be carried out using motorized transportation (e.g., buses, cars, motorcycles, etc.) instead of non-motorized modes (mainly by bike or foot). The classification is based on speed, duration, distance, average speed, and other spatiotemporal features.

**Unit:** percentage - **daily temporal resolution and not on hourly basis**

**Value Range:** 0 - 100 [%];

**Color Range:** linear scale [0 - 100]
