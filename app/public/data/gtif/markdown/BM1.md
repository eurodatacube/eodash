## Sustainable forest management for a green future

The European Commission has adopted the new [EU Forest Strategy](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/forest-strategy_en) for 2030, a flagship initiative of
the EU Green Deal, and foreseen contributor to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Overall, the
new Strategy is designed to protect and restore EU forests and their vital role in tackling climate
change and biodiversity loss. As part of the "[Fit for 55](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en)" legislative package to increase the carbon
removals to -310 millions of tonnes CO 2 equivalent by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality in the
combined land use, forestry and agriculture sector by 2035 at EU level. Ensuring resilient forest
ecosystems and enabling forests to deliver on their multifunctional role is therefore an indispensable
part for a green future.
GTIF Austria is addressing support for sustainable forest management to adapt practices in a
changing climate. More frequent extreme weather events like devasting thunderstorms and long
drought periods will shape our future.
