## Forests for a green future

The European Commission has adopted the communication of the new [EU Forest Strategy](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/forest-strategy_en) for 2030, a flagship initiative of the EU Green Deal, and foreseen contributor to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Overall, the new Strategy is designed to protect and restore EU forests and their vital role in tackling climate change and biodiversity loss. As part of the "[Fit for 55](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en)" legislative package to increase the carbon removals to -310 millions of tonnes CO 2 equivalent by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality in the combined land use, forestry and agriculture sector by 2035 at EU level. Ensuring resilient forest ecosystems and enabling forests to deliver on their multifunctional role is therefore an indispensable part for a green future.
