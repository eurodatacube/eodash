Changes in forested land from 2020 to 2021 are indicated in red within the green forest mask. They can be combined with biomass map for loss of wood which is available for larger administrative units e.g. Bundesl√§nder.


**Disclaimer**: The biomass loss values are currently a demonstration of the type of information based on global estimates. More refined values will be derived from dedicated mapping in Austria in the near future.
