## Disclaimer

Please note that the provided estimates for Dynamic Human Presence may not be entirely
accurate, mainly due to the collection mechanisms of the data used to generate the estimates.
Indeed, location-based data collected from mobile devices can sometimes overestimate or
underestimate the number of people in a given area, depending on how many mobile devices
are being used and what applications are installed on those devices. This is because not
everyone has a GPS-enabled mobile device, and even those who do have mobile devices might
have different apps installed, which can affect the collected data. Generally, we expect the
population density and count estimates to have a relative error of approximately 10%, which
may increase in very densely or very sparsely populated areas.
