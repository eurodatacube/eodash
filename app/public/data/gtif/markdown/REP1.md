### Wind Power Density
The wind power density (w m 2 ) is a measure of the available wind resource. Higher wind power density
indicates greater wind power potential.


### Distance to Settlement
Each federal province in Austria has distance requirements between wind turbines and settlements.
Increase the minimum distance to select areas further from settlements.


### Distance to transmission network
Wind turbines are optimally placed close to the existing transmission network. Reduce this distance to
select areas closer to the network.


### Protected areas
Conservation areas such as Natura 2000 sites and Nationally designated areas are protected, and should be
avoided when positioning wind turbines.


### Slope
Generally, flatter terrain is preferred for wind turbine locations. Typical suitability studies choose land with
slope of less than 15-20 degrees.


### Elevation
Generally, lower elevation areas are preferred for turbine locations. Selecting areas below 2,000 m avoids
many mountainous and inaccessible areas.

### RIX
The Ruggedness Index is a measure of the steepness of the terrain in the surrounding area. Uncertainty in
wind density estimates increase with higher RIX values.
