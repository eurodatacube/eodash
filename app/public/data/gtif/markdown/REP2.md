### Solar irradiance (kWh/m 2\*yr)

The greater amount of solar irradiation, the more electricity can be generated by a solar cell module.
Selecting area with high solar potential contributes significantly to the desired efficiency and economic
feasibility of a solar power project.

### Slope &amp; Aspect

Gentle terrain is preferred for solar panel installation. Typical suitability studies choose land with slope of
less than 5-15 degrees and with a slope orientation facing in south, southeast, southwest direction (i.e., an
aspect in the range of 135-225 degrees).

### Elevation

Installation of solar panels in high altitude areas (e.g., 1500 m amsl) can be challenging due to increased
transportation cost, suitability of technology, access to the grid, as well as routine and emergency
maintenance.

### Distance to transmission network

Solar power panels are optimally placed close to the existing transmission network. Reduce this distance to
select areas closer to the network.

### Protected areas

Solar power facilities are not typically proposed in conservation areas such as Natura 2000 sites and
nationally designated areas.
