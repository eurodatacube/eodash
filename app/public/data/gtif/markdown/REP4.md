# HydroPower

Austriaâ€™s alpine topography, numerous rivers and high precipitation present the country with significant water resources. Hydropower today accounts for more than half of total installed power generating capacity.

Monitoring of reservoir level and its storage capacity has a significant importance in evaluation of the state and changes in the energy storage. Consistent observations of reservoir storage are often difficult to access or can be limited for general public. This lack of observational data makes it challenging to provide a general overview of the reservoir storage and the current energy potential available at national level. Earth Observation can provide information on two important parameters for monitoring reservoirs and hydropower status: Water Surface Elevation (WSE) and Surface Water Extent (SWE).

Independently, WSE and SWE can act as status indicators on the hydro power storage in a country. Any significant deviation from the norms should attract attention for the national energy planning. WSE and SWE can also be combined to derive accurate time series of reservoir storage changes based on hypsometric relations between surface water area extent and elevation, and formulas for estimating potential hydropower generation and storage.
