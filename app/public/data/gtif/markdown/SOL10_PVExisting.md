## PV Detections

Solar Roofs products are a cutting-edge solution for mapping and assessing the presence of photovoltaic (PV) panels on roofs. These products are based on the latest available airborne imagery with a spatial resolution of 20 cm, providing a high level of detail and accuracy. The Solar Roofs products are designed to provide building-level information about the presence of PV panels on roofs, including their size and potential electric power output. This information is generated by analysing the airborne imagery as well as digital surface model data and applying performance ratios and efficiency data for the PV panels.

 

**Please note that the dataset provided covers the entire region of Austria (excluding Vienna). However, it may contain incorrect information regarding buildings within the Zell am See and Nordburgenland areas due to missing data. Please be aware that this dataset is subject to change and will be updated if additional airborne imagery becomes available.**
