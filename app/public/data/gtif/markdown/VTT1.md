## Basal area

Basal area is the cross-sectional area of trees at breast height (~ 1.3m above ground. It is a common way to describe stand density. In forest management, basal area usually refers to merchantable timber and is given on a per hectare basis.

**Disclaimer**: The forest parameter values are the output of a growth model based on EO and meteorological data, and are not yet validated.
