| Product description | **Nitrogen Dioxide**<br>Earth observing satellites like the TROPOMI instrument on the Copernicus Sentinel-5P are being used to map air pollution worldwide. One of the variables that it can provide information is on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is linked to pollutant sectors such as traffic and industrial activities.<br>**Removal of atmospheric disturbances**<br>NO2 measurements from satellite can be affected by alteration caused e.g. by aerosol content and by the presence of clouds. To account for these disturbances, a masking process is applied to the collected images using ancillary information and cloud products provided by Sentinel-5P. The following rules / thresholds are applied:<br>- Only pixels featuring Quality Assurance Value ≥ 50 are considered (see https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/2476257/sentinel-5p-tropomi-atbd-no2-data-products Appendix E)<br>- Only pixels featuring cloud fraction ≤ 0,4 are considered (see https://data-portal.s5p-pal.com/product-docs/no2/PAL_reprocessing_NO2_v02.03.01_20211215.pdf reporting 0.5 as moderate cloudiness)<br>**Spatial regridding**<br>Satellite observations are obtained from different angles thus the observation geometry and the respecting footprint differ from acquisition to acquisition within the same revisiting period. .To enable pixel-based comparison among different images, a regridding operation over a fixed grid was implemented. The target grid is equirectangular with 0.035° (~4 km) mash, that allows maintaining resolution similar to the original product (3.5 km x 5.5 km). The interpolation is performed using a nearest neighbour algorithm. Regridding is applied to already masked images.<br>**Temporal aggregation**<br>The nitrogen dioxide concentrations vary from day to day due to changes in the weather (such as wind speed, cloudiness, etc) and conclusions cannot be drawn based on just one day of data alone. By combining data for a specific period of time (averaging over 14 days) the meteorological variability and observation disturbances partially average out and impact of changes due to human activity become more clearly visible. The average is performed on pixels where at least two measurements are available in the average period.|
