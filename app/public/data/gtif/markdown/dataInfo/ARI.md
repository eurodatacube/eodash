| Product description | The Aggregate Risk Index (ARI) is an index that provides a measure of the health outcome-specific risk due to the short-term exposure to multiple air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3). It is derived by additively summing the product of pollutant concentration weighted using health outcome-specific Relative Risk factors of increased mortality due to all causes, provided by the World Health Organization. |
