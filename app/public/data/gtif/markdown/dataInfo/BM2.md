|Product Name| FCM 20 m above ground biomass |
| --- | --- |
| Spatial resolution | 20m |
| Temporal reference | 2021 |
| Value range | 0-652 (t/ha) |
| Spatial coverage | Austria (9.5°, 46.3°, 17.2°, 49.0°) |
| Product description | The product provides estimates of above ground biomass (AGB) in t/ha in 20 m spatial resolution. The estimation was conducted with the BIOMASAR approach (Santoro et al. 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112235) developed at Gamma Remote Sensing (https://www.gamma-rs.ch/).  |

| Reported accuracy | Based on opportunistic sample of NFI plots around Europe (but none in Austria), in full resolution, the product has good agreement for the lower biomass ranges with the tendency of a slight overestimation in the 25-50 t/ha range. Mapped biomass tend to be underestimated beyond 125-150 t/ha and the bias increases with increasing biomass. When aggregated to 10 km x 10 km areas, the estimates become more reliable with the RMSE of 29 t/ha and bias of 12 t/ha.
