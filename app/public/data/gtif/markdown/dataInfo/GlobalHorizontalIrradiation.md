| Product description | Average daily global horizontal radiation over a season (winter – DJF, spring – MAM, summer – JJA, autumn – SON) and a whole year. Reference information for the assessment of flat-plate PV (photovoltaic) and solar heating technologies (e.g. hot water). It was derived by calculating 10-year climatology of hourly solar irradiance (based on ERA5 reanalysis data) and adjusting it for elevation changes and shadowing using 10 m digital elevation model (Copernicus EEA-10).|
