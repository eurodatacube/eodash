| Product description | Long-term yearly average of global horizontal irradiation - Austria - Global Solar Atlas 2.0. Reference information for the assessment of flat-plate PV (photovoltaic) and solar heating technologies (e.g. hot water). This data layer represents an output from the Solargis global solar model. It has been delivered for the Global Solar Atlas (https://globalsolaratlas.info/), online platform funded by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), a multi-donor trust fund administered by The World Bank, under a global initiative on Renewable Energy Resource Mapping. <br> Solar radiation data from satellite-based model developed by Solargis company. Solar radiation data is derived by Solargis algorithms (v2.1) from satellite digital images and atmospheric datasets. <br> Data was resampled from native resolution of 0.0025 degrees to approx. 10m using gdal and the bilinear method.|
