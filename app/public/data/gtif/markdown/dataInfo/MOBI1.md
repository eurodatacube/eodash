| Product description | The steadily growing stream of digital traces logging human activities unlocked the possibility of studying and characterizing human mobility using location-based data passively collected from mobile devices. Amongst other, High-Frequency Location-Based data (HFLB) is one of the most precise proxy of human mobility, as it records the individuals’ devices location with an unprecedented level of spatial accuracy and temporal resolution.<br>The "Dynamic human presence" product leverages HFLB data to estimate thespatial-temporal population dynamics at the Zählsprengel level and hourly time steps.Specifically, it has been derived by concurrently exploiting HFLB (which allows to estimate a prior of the occupation rate of a given unit by counting the number of single devicesobserved within an area at a given time) and census statistics (which report the reference number of residents and in-out commuters per unit) to infer the number of people (or their density) in space and time. This allows overcoming the limitations deriving from the sole employment of static census counts, for example providing a dynamic estimate of the population exposed to natural hazards such as flood or landslides.<br>The product features two indicators, namely:<ul><li>**Population count** The Population Count [#people] indicator reports the number of people present in a given census area on an hourly basis. In particular, calibration is carried out by comparing the activity in the area (i.e., the number of people present therein) with its average occupation in normal conditions (i.e., far from holiday breaks), then scaling the per-area population count obtained from location-based data to match the national population.</li><li>**Population density** The Population Density [#people/km2] indicator is directly derived from the Population Count by dividing the population count hourly estimates by the surface (in square kilometers) of the given census area. In particular, it allows to effectively compare the occupation rate of census areas featuring different surface extension and number of inhabitants. |

| Reported accuracy | The human presence estimates based on data passively collected from mobile devices are known to possibly overestimate population in densely occupied areas while underestimating it in sparsely populated areas. This is due to an inherent bias introduced by the data collection mechanism: the adoption rate of the mobile devices used to collect data is not homogeneous in the population and might depend on the applications installed on the given device (indeed, only some of them provide location data). In general, population count estimates have an average ±10% confidence interval on the projected number that can go up to ±30% relative error in densely populated areas. The confidence interval can extend up to ±70% in less populated areas due to a severe underrepresentation of the resident population. |
