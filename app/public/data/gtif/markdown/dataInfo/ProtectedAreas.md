| Product description | The dataset Nationally designated areas (CDDA) contains data on individual nationally Designated Areas and corresponding Protected Site spatial features in EEA member and collaborating countries.<br>The data for the nationally designated protected areas inventory is delivered by the Eionet partnership countries as spatial and tabular information. The inventory began in 1995 under the CORINE program of the European Commission. The CDDA is now an agreed annual Eionet core data flow maintained by the European Environment Agency (EEA) with support from the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity (ETC/BD). The dataset is used by the EEA and e.g., the UNEP-WCMC for their main European and global assessments, products and services. The CDDA is the official source of protected area information from the 38 European countries to the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA). Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, it ceased to be part of the EEA’s institutional networks and governance.|
