| Product description | The Ruggedness Index (RIX) number is defined as the fractional extent of the terrain that exceeds a critical slope, in this case 16.7 ∘, within 3500m of the point of interest. The RIX number is used in the modelling process to indicate terrain where the surrounding orographic slopes are steeper than the valid limits of the flow model and thus where the orographic speed-ups are expected to be overestimated.|
