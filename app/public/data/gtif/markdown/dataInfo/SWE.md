| Product description | The SWE product is derived from continuous observations of high-resolution radar and optical data. It is based on a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the surface water probability from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The dual sensor approach acknowledges the limitations to surface water mapping when relying solely on either optical or SAR based instruments and aims to take advantage of the individual sensors strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. The surface water product has higher spatial resolution (10 m) compared to the existing products, is not impacted by cloud coverage, and can be run in near-real time to detect surface water changes at national scale. |
