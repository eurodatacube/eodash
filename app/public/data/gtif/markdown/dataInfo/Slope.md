| Product description | The Copernicus DEM is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) that represents the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure and vegetation. Data were acquired through the TanDEM-X mission between 2011 and 2015. The datasets were made available for use in 2019 and will be maintained until 2026.<br>Slope is estimated using the Copernicus DEM. |

| Reported accuracy | For the DEM: Absolute vertical accuracy < 4 m (90 % linear error). Relative vertical accuracy < 2 m for slopes below or equal 20 %; < 4 m for slopes above 20 %; (90 % linear point-to-point error within an area of 1° x 1°). Absolute horizontal accuracy < 6 m (90 % circular error).|
