| Product description | Solar Roofs products are a cutting-edge solution for mapping and assessing the presence of photovoltaic (PV) panels on roofs. These products are based on the latest available airborne imagery with a spatial resolution of 20 cm, providing a high level of detail and accuracy.<br>The Solar Roofs products are designed to provide building-level information about the presence of PV panels on roofs, including their size and potential electric power output. This information is generated by analysing the airborne imagery as well as digital surface model data and applying performance ratios and efficiency data for the PV panels. One of the main benefits of using Solar Roofs products is their ability to provide detailed information about the potential electric power that could be produced by the PV panels. This information is critical for understanding the potential of rooftop solar installations and making informed decisions about the deployment of renewable energy systems. In particular, the computed indicators include: <br> Existing PV Panels: describes the presence of PV panels on buildings. <br>Total electric power production potential - High performance: describes the potential electric power in MWh that can be produced considering that the PV has a high-performance ratio [92%] and a high efficiency [23%]. <br> Total electric power production potential - Regular performance: describes the potential electric power in MWh that can be produced considering that the PV has a regular-performance ratio [86%] and a high efficiency [19%].<br>Total electric power production potential - Low performance: describes the potential electric power in MWh that can be produced considering that the PV has a low-performance ratio [80%] and a high efficiency [15%].|
