| Product description | The mean wind power density (w m 2 ) is a measure of available wind resource at any location. It is related to the cube of the wind speed and can provide additional information about thestrength of the wind not found in the mean wind speed alone. The measure describes the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine and is calculated for different heights above ground. Here we report wind power density estimates at 50m, 100m and 200m above ground.<br/>The wind power density estimates are made using a similar approach to the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) with some notable improvements and modifications. The methodology is developed by the Danish Technical University (DTU) and relies on first running a mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 3km resolution forced by ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2018), followed by a downscaling to 50m using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP).<br/>The wind time series were obtained from output from WRF version 3.8.1 with a setup following Hahmann et. al. (2021). Pywasp version 0.5.1 was used to generalize the time series given the roughness length and elevation maps from the WRF model. The stability was obtained by calculating the temperature scale from the WRF output following Floors et al (2023). The air density was calculated following Floors and Nielsen (2017). There were upgrades made to several of the input datasets used for the pyWAsP downscaling compared to the NEWA dataset:<ol><li>The Copernicus 10m DEM replaced the SRTM 90m DEM.</li><li>The ESA WorldCover (2021) data replaced the Corine Land Cover (2018)</li><li>Roughness Length estimates over forests were improved by including canopy height estimates derived from Sentinel-2 (Lang et. al. 2022 arxiv.org/abs/2204.08322).</li>|

(2022) – resampled to 50m using bilinear resampling. |

| Reported accuracy | There is a recognized overestimate of wind power density in areas with complex terrain (e.g. mountainous regions). Areas of complex terrain can be identified using the Ruggedness Index (RIX).<br/> This data set is not validated, however the production of this data followed a similar approach to the NEWA. In General, the values from this product correlated well with the NEWA dataset, however values in this dataset were found to be slightly lower. Additionally, the effect of forests on wind power is more clearly seen in this dataset compared to the NEWA data, especially at 50m and 100m hub heights.<br/> Validation scores for this dataset are expected to be close to the NEWA dataset, and with the improvements in input data used by this product, improvements in wind power estimates are also expected, especially close to forested regions. For reference, validation of the New European Wind Atlas has been done using wind masts and is divided into 3 categories, defined by the RIX Index groups: Low (0%), Medium (0-2%) High (&gt;2%). Mean wind power is generally overestimated compared to ground data with the following bias:<br/> Average: 13.3 %±27.4 %<br/> Low RIX: 7.3 %±17.6 %<br/> Medium RIX: 13.1 %±21.5%<br/> High RIX: 21.2 %±36.7 %<br/> Large RIX values will lead to large errors in the flow modeling, most likely leading to an overestimation of mean wind speeds on ridges and hilltops. We therefore recommend users to inspect the RIX of their region of interest. |
