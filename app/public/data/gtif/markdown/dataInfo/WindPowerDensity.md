| Product description | The mean wind power density (w m2) is a measure of available wind resource at any location. It is related to the cube of the wind speed and can provide additional information about the strength of the wind not found in the mean wind speed alone. The measure describes the mean annual power available per square meter of swept area of a turbine and is calculated for different heights above ground. Here we report wind power density estimates at 50m, 100m and 200m above ground. <br>The wind power density estimates are based on modelled data from the New European Wind Atlas. This is a high-quality and validated dataset providing estimates at 50m resolution for entire Europe and resampled to 10m using the bilinear method for the GTIF project to match other spatial datasets. The methodology is developed by the Danish Technical University (DTU) and partners and relies on first running a mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 3km resolution forced by ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2018), followed by a downscaling to 50m using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). Other satellite-based inputs include a Digital Elevation Model, and roughness length estimates derived from Corine Land Cover.|

| Reported accuracy | There is a recognized overestimate of wind power density in areas with complex terrain (e.g. mountainous regions). Areas of complex terrain can be identified using the Ruggedness Index (RIX). <br>Validation of the New European Wind Atlas has been done using wind masts and is divided into 3 categories, defined by the RIX Index groups: Low (0%), Medium (0-2%) High (>2%). Mean wind power is generally overestimated compared to ground data with the following bias:<br>Average: 13.3 %±27.4 %<br>Low RIX: 7.3 %±17.6 %<br>Medium RIX: 13.1 %±21.5%<br>High RIX: 21.2 %±36.7 %<br>Large RIX values will lead to large errors in the flow modeling, most likely leading to an overestimation of mean wind speeds on ridges and hilltops. We therefore recommend users to inspect the RIX of their region of interest. |
