## ESA WEB analytics Cookie notice

### ESA Web Analytics Cookies

ESA Webanalytics is an ESA IT corporate service applied to monitor the performance of ESA websites. It draws on Matomo, an open-source analytics platform, fully controlled and privacy-configured by the ESA, to protect personal data. Matomo aggregated data: refers to accumulated (aggregated) data derived from a large number of visitors. Individual visitor's data cannot be retrieved from the aggregated form. It is used to understand more general visitor behaviours, transitions, preferences. This aggregated data is processed by Matomo in the following functionalities: Locations, Devices, Software, Times, Dashboard. Behaviours, Visitors' summary. In order to comply with full anonymity requirements, the "Visits' log" and "Real-time" menu in the master configuration of the service "ESA Web Analytics" were disabled, with the consequence that end-users would only have access to aggregated data. 

### Protection of Personal Data and ESA Web Analytics

ESA controls the data. ESA Web Analytics is configured to use the gtif.esa.int and stores first-party cookies on ESA premises in Europe.
Cookies (drawing on Matomo) applied by ESA Web Analytics track website visitors for the purpose of reporting on visitor actions in aggregated statistics reports (that exclude personal data) as follows:

- IP address: the IP address is gathered from visitors but directly masked up to the last 2 bytes before it is stored and written into the Matomo database, meaning that the specific IP address of a user (in its full form) is never stored on ESA servers. 
- Location: ESA is not able to locate individual visitors up to the country/region level. This category of data is mainly used in the "Real-time map" functionality of Matomo. This data is thus "aggregated”.
- "Visitor's log": displays the history of the monitored pages which have been visited by an individual visitor over a period of time (maximum 6 months due to limitation of cookie pk_id). This category refers to data which helps to retrieve individual data of a visitor (even if the identity of the visitor remains unknown).
- Title of the page being viewed (Page Title);
- URL of the page being viewed (Page URL);
- URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (Referrer URL);
- Screen resolution of user's device;
- "Real-time" is offers the possibility to see the live activity of individual visitors on the monitored website. This category refers to data which helps to retrieve individual data of a visitor (even if the identity of the visitor remains unknown).
- Files that were clicked and downloaded (Download);
- Links to an outside domain that were clicked (Outlink);
- Pages generation time (the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the webserver and then downloaded by the visitor: Page speed);
- Main language of the browser used (Accept-Language header);
- Browser version, browser plugins (PDF, Flash, Java, …) operating system version, device identifier (User-Agent header);
- Language of the visited page;
- Campaigns;
- Site Search;
- Events.

To improve the accuracy of the produced reports, information is also stored in a first-party cookie from the ESA website and then collected by ESA Web Analytics:

- Random unique Visitor ID;
- Time of the first visit for the specific visitor;
- Time of the previous visit for the specific visitor;
- Number of visits for the specific visitor.

ESA Web Analytics uses the following cookies:
