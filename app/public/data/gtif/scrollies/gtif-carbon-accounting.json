Concentration of GHG like CO 2 and methane reaches each year new records. Carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities e.g. during the life cycle of\na product. “Net zero” means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere, by oceans and forests for instance.\n\nThe European Commission has adopted the communication on its new [EU Forest Strategy](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/forest-strategy_en) for 2030, a flagship initiative of the EU Green Deal, and foreseen contributor to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Overall, the new Strategy is designed to protect and restore EU forests and their vital role in tackling climate change and biodiversity loss. As part of the \"[Fit for 55](https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green-deal_en)\" legislative package to increase the carbon removals to -310 millions of tonnes CO 2 equivalent by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality in the combined land use, forestry and agriculture sector by 2035 at EU level. Ensuring resilient forest ecosystems and enabling forests to deliver on their multifunctional role is therefore an indispensable part for a\ngreen future.\n\nSustainable managed forests can restore increasing carbon stocks while simultaneously providing a sustainable supply of products, which are renewable, recyclable and have a\nsmaller carbon footprint than several substitutes. GTIF Carbon Accounting assess the gains and losses of carbon in forests as an indispensable step towards the net zero target.\n\n</div>",
