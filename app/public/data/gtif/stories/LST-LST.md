## Heat Stress over Austria

The data viewer provides a uniform coverage of observations of the ECOSTRESS instrument mounted on the International Space Station.

Data shows land surface temperatures measured during early afternoon hours in °C. The map is composed of single observations acquired between June 1st to June 24th, in order to result in an almost cloud-free image.

Additional analytical elements are presented on commune level featuring min, max and mean land surface temperatures, as well as the percentage of the residential population exposed to surface temperatures above 35°C.

## Background

June 2022 marked a record-breaking month with air temperatures in excess of the historic average for the time of year in Central Europe. Monthly average temperature was at 2.3°C above the long-term average for 1991-2020, and bigger Austrian cities like Vienna or Innsbruck featured more than 10 heat days with maximum temperatures exceeding 30°.

Air temperature is different to the temperature on the land surface and the subjective perceived temperature. Higher air temperatures, especially during longer heat waves, cause a strong increase of surface temperatures especially in areas which are built-up or sealed by concrete or asphalt. This is known as the Urban Heat Island effect, where an urban area is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas. Heat islands contribute to higher daytime temperatures, reduced nighttime cooling, and higher air-pollution levels, in turn amplifying heat-related health issues and stress factors on both humans and animals. Studies show that depending on meteorological factors, such as humidity or wind, subjective heat stress starts at around 23-25°, and intense heat stress is felt above 35°.

Responding to global warming and adapting to climate change effects such as heat waves and drought is a key priority of Austria’s national Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. Cities are increasingly responding to this threat by formulating heat protection plans and initiating adaptation measures. Adaptation options include the reduction of heat emissions from fuel combustion or the climate proofing of buildings through better isolation. Nature-based solutions are increasingly followed, as these are longer-lasting with benefits for a variety of sectors. Such ‘green measures’ entail establishing a better land use mix by limiting the construction of new impermeable surfaces to reduce heat absorption, and offering shade and cooling through more green spaces and open water.

Land surface temperature is one of 54 Essential Climate Variables defined by the Global Climate Observing System to monitor climate change. Satellite-based analyses of global land surface temperatures span several decades and are typically provided in moderate spatial resolution (up to 0.1°), such as from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Landsat 9’s Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) records land surface temperature in two thermal infrared bands in 100m spatial resolution. The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), an instrument owned by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) carried on the International Space Station, measures land surface temperature in 70m spatial resolution and enables more localized assessments down to city scales. Through the European Copernicus program, the European Space Agency is planning to launch a Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM) mission (Sentinel-8) which will carry a thermal infrared sensor to provide global observations of land-surface temperature in so far unprecedented spatial resolution.
