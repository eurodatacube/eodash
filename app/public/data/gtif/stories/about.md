## Green Transition Information Factory (GTIF)

The Green Transition Information Factory concept is a key element of the ESA Space For Green Future
Accelerator. It was decided to implement a first demonstration for the country of Austria (GTIF AT).
The overall ambition is to take advantage of EO and geospatial data together with digital platform
technologies to generate and provide actionable knowledge and decision support focussing on
national Green Transition priorities in Austria. Information generated and provided by GTIF should
support Austrian stakeholders and policy makers in their implementation of the Green Transition
through monitoring, reporting and verification of implemented actions. In addition, GTIF AT will be
developed as a pathfinder so that it can later be replicated for other member states using the same
technology solution.
