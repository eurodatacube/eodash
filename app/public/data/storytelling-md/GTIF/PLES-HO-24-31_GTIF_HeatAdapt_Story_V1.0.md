# Insights into Urban Heat and Sustainable Planning: Lessons learnt from three distinct Austrian landscape
As cities around the world grapple with the challenges of urbanization, **three municipalities** in Austria provide valuable insights into managing the delicate relationship between development and the environment. These case studies highlight how a region's unique geography, land use patterns, and degree of urbanization shape its local climate. As cities plan for the future, carefully managing the tradeoffs between development and environmental preservation will be essential for creating resilient, livable communities. The lessons from Austria's diverse municipalities can guide urban planners worldwide in their quest for climate-conscious growth:

##  <!--{as="img" src="https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash-assets/blob/main/stories/heatadapt/3cities.png?raw=true" style="width: 100%"}-->

* In the **alpine city of Innsbruck**, the rugged terrain limits large-scale construction, preserving natural landscapes. However, the urban core still experiences an elevated heat island effect, with sealed surfaces contributing to higher temperatures. Strategies to reduce impervious cover and promote green spaces could help mitigate this issue.

* In contrast, **Vienna's Mariahilf district embodies dense urban development**, with over 86% of the area covered in impermeable materials. This intense sealing drives up land surface temperatures, creating a pronounced heat island. Investing in green infrastructure and rethinking urban design will be crucial for cooling this district.

* On the **rural-urban spectrum lies Tulln an der Donau**, a municipality dominated by agricultural land and deciduous forests. While some urban heat is detectable in settled areas, the overall temperature impact is relatively mild compared to highly urbanized regions. This balance of natural and built environments offers insights into sustainable development pathways.

Let's have look on each of these cases, and lessons learnt in particular during the high temperatures felt in 2023:


## The Alpine Oasis of Innsbruck - and the urban heat of 2023
Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol, is surrounded by towering alpine mountains that contribute to its reputation as a premier destination for winter sports and alpine activities. Sitting at an elevation of 574 meters, the city experiences a humid continental climate with significant alpine influences. Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are moderately warm, with average temperatures in July reaching 18°C. Analysis of Innsbruck's land surface temperatures (LST) in 2023 reveals an intriguing contrast between the city's urban core and its broader municipal boundaries. The mean LST across the entire municipality was 19.36°C, with a recorded maximum of 28.53°C and a minimum of 9.33°C. However, when focusing solely on the settled areas, the average LST jumped to 23.62°C, indicating a clear urban heat island effect.

####  The Impact of Sealed Surfaces and land cover distribution
A key driver of this elevated temperature in the urban zones is the degree of sealed surfaces. While the municipality as a whole has an average of 12.44% sealed surfaces, this figure rises significantly to 32.5% in the more developed areas. The replacement of natural landscapes with impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt traps heat, limiting the cooling effects of vegetation and contributing to the heat island phenomenon.
Looking at the land cover data, Innsbruck's municipal area is dominated by coniferous forests (24.99%) and rocky, scree-covered terrain (18.37%), reflecting the city's alpine setting. Unvegetated settlements account for 16.47% of the total area. However, within the settled zones, the landscape shifts, with rocks and screes remaining the largest category at 18.37%, followed by unvegetated settlements at 16.47% and grassland at 13.69%.

#### Sustainable planning for Innsbruck Future: Urbanization and Surface Temperature Correlation
A scatter plot analysis reveals a positive correlation between soil sealing and land surface temperature (LST), underscoring how urbanization raises LST by replacing natural vegetation, reducing cooling effects, and increasing heat retention. This leads to environmental impacts such as increased energy consumption, higher greenhouse gas emissions, and disrupted microclimates. Sustainable urban planning practices that reduce soil sealing and incorporate green spaces are essential for mitigating rising surface temperatures.

The 2023 data highlight Innsbruck's alpine setting and rocky landscape, which shape its land use and climate. While urbanization influences 
temperatures in settled areas, development remains constrained by the surrounding mountains. Balancing urban and natural landscapes is crucial for Innsbruck's sustainable growth, supporting climate adaptation strategies that harmonize its alpine heritage with urban development.

## The Densely Packed Mariahilf District
In stark contrast to Innsbruck's alpine setting, Vienna's Mariahilf district represents the epitome of urban density. As one of the city's smallest districts, Mariahilf covers an area of just 1.48 square kilometers, yet is home to around 31,000 residents, resulting in a population density of approximately 20,946 per square kilometer. This compact environment is reflected in Mariahilf's land surface temperatures, which averaged 31.48°C in 2023, with a maximum of 32.52°C and a minimum of 30.84°C. Interestingly, even when focusing solely on the settled areas, the average LST remained consistent with the broader district, suggesting a pervasive impact of urbanization on local temperature.

####  The Impact of Sealed Surfaces
The primary driver of Mariahilf's elevated temperatures is the overwhelming presence of sealed surfaces, which cover a staggering 86.17% of the district's area. This near-complete absence of permeable ground and natural vegetation robs the district of the cooling benefits provided by evapotranspiration and shading, leading to the intensification of the urban heat island effect.
Analyzing the land cover data further emphasizes Mariahilf's urban character. Unvegetated settlements account for 95.27% of the district, followed by trees in settlements (3.72%) and grassland in settlements (1.01%). This landscape is devoid of substantial natural vegetation, which could otherwise help mitigate the heat island phenomenon.

</div>

Interestingly, and contrarily to expectations of a clear positive correlation (as impervious surfaces usually absorb more heat), the data shows a scattered distribution, indicating no
obvious pattern. Several factors may explain this. Data limitations such as small geographic
coverage, lack of temporal variability, and insufficient resolution could obscure the underlying
trends. If the data represents only a short timeframe or specific conditions, it may fail to
capture broader seasonal or diurnal patterns. Outliers and microclimatic factors by be
another reason as smaller datasets may disproportionately capture impact results,
introducing noise that makes interpretation challenging. To draw more accurate conclusions,
further research should include larger datasets, better spatial-temporal coverage, and
advanced models that control for confounding factors and spatial relationships.

These findings highlight Mariahilf&#39;s status as a bustling, highly urbanized district within
Vienna, where impervious surfaces and limited green spaces contribute significantly to local
temperature dynamics. The district&#39;s high degree of sealed surfaces and low vegetation
cover play crucial roles in elevating land surface temperatures, intensifying the urban heat
island effect. These characteristics are vital considerations for urban planners looking to
mitigate heat stress and improve climate resilience in Mariahilf.

## Tulln an der Donau: Balancing Rural and Urban Influences
Tulln an der Donau is a municipality located in the state of Lower Austria (Niederösterreich),
serving as the administrative center of the Tulln district. Geographically positioned on the
banks of the Danube River, it lies approximately 40 kilometers northwest of Vienna, making it
a part of the Vienna metropolitan area. The town covers an area of about 72.23 square
kilometers, characterized by a mix of urban development and fertile agricultural land. Tulln an
der Donau has an estimated population of approximately 17,000 residents. Tulln an der
Donau falls within the Pannonian climatic zone, which is prevalent in the eastern regions of
Austria. This climate is characterized by continental features, including hot summers and
cold winters, with relatively low precipitation compared to the alpine regions. The area
experiences an average annual temperature of around 10°C, and the Danube River
influences local weather patterns, contributing to occasional foggy conditions. The district of
Tulln encompasses a variety of landscapes, including agricultural plains, vineyards, and

####  2023's distinct temperatures between rural and urban fabrics

In 2023, Tulln an der Donau recorded a mean land surface temperature (LST) of 28.13°C, with extremes ranging from 24.36°C to a high of 33.61°C. When focusing on settled areas, where human infrastructure is more concentrated, the mean LST rises to 29.43°C. This difference highlights the mild urban heat island (UHI) effect present in Tulln, where urban surfaces—primarily roads, buildings, and other sealed surfaces—trap heat, creating a warmer local microclimate. During the summer months of June through August 2022, the maximum land surface temperature across Tulln reached 46.68°C, with an average maximum temperature of 39.15°C.

While Tulln has an average sealing rate of only 7.01% across its entire area, this rises to nearly 19.55% in settled zones. Although these levels are relatively low compared to densely populated urban areas, they nonetheless contribute to heat retention, elevating minimum temperatures in settled areas. The increased temperatures are a visible outcome of soil sealing, which diminishes natural cooling processes like shading and evapotranspiration, making even mild UHIs more impactful for local residents and ecosystems. Tulln an der Donau’s landscape is defined largely by agriculture. The municipality’s land cover data reveals that annual cropland is the dominant land use, occupying 33.79% of the total area, while deciduous forests cover 30.87%. Urban areas or unvegetated settlements make up only 10.21%, underscoring the town’s rural character. Even within settled zones, agriculture continues to play a significant role, with cropland covering 21.26% of the area and forests accounting for 15.57%.

Analysis of soil sealing and its correlation with land surface temperature further illustrates the environmental challenges facing Tulln. As soil sealing percentages increase, so do LST values, indicating a clear positive correlation. Urbanized zones with higher levels of impermeable surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt, absorb and retain more heat, leading to elevated temperatures and reduced cooling effects. This phenomenon underscores the environmental impact of urbanization and highlights the importance of sustainable planning. The inclusion of green spaces and the careful management of soil sealing are vital strategies for mitigating the urban heat island effect, improving environmental sustainability, and enhancing the quality of life for Tulln’s residents.

In conclusion, Tulln an der Donau reflects a town where agricultural practices and rural landscapes dominate, with a mild urban heat island effect due to limited urbanization and lower soil sealing levels. Through thoughtful urban planning and a commitment to preserving green spaces, Tulln can continue to balance its agricultural heritage with the demands of a changing climate, serving as a model for rural-urban balance in an era of environmental challenges.
