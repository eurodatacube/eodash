## El Niño 2023-2024: impacts on food security
The ongoing El Niño which was expected to dissipate by mid-2024 [1]( https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity ) still impacting both, negatively and positively, food security across the world. Whereas some agriculture regions  face flood disasters, while others are facing droughts caused by El Niño-induced decreased rainfall, affecting agricultural yields and altering trade flows in the 2023-2024 seasons [2]( https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/061523-factbox-mapping-el-ninos-impact-on-crop-yields-global-food-trade-in-2023-24 ), according to agricultural institutions, meteorological agencies and trade analysts. In fact, as El Niño strengthened in 2023, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) forecasted mixed impacts on food security [3](https://agrilinks.org/post/el-nino-strengthens-famine-early-warning-systems-network-forecasts-mixed-impacts-food-security ). High levels of acute food insecurity in certain regions were expected, and [FEWS NET projections](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews) indicated that 105-110 million people across 31 regions will need food assistance through early 20242025? as a result of weather, conflict and economic shocks [4]( https://agrilinks.org/post/el-nino-strengthens-famine-early-warning-systems-network-forecasts-mixed-impacts-food-security ) [5](https://fews.net/our-services/food-assistance-outlook-briefs ).

Regarding negative impacts, they are primarily due to heat. Such stress on crops caused water loss, delayed growth, reduced pollination, impaired seeding or root growth, withered or yellowed leaves, reduced tiller (grain bearing branch) number and seedling death in plants [6](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2023-53-rice-production-and-food-security-in-southeast-asia-under-threat-from-el-nino-by-elyssa-ludher-and-paul-teng/ ).

#### Southern Africa: maize and corn main producers at risk
Maize is the single most important cereal group in southern Africa, accounting for almost 70% of the regions’ production. During other El Niño events, maize production saw declines of 10 to 15% relative to expected yields [7](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity ). During the current El Niño, the below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures in southern Africa (Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa) negatively impacted crops yields especially staples like maize [8](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-food-security-alert-strong-el-nino-event-will-contribute-high-food-assistance-needs-through-2024-october-3-2023) [9]( https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity ) . Recent forecasts estimated corn production drop in these regions, specifically in Zambia and South Africa, the two of the largest corn producers will fall in 2024/2025 by 41.8% and 9.1%, respectively [10](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/agribusiness/el-nino-linked-declines-corn-production-south-africa-and-zambia-tighten-supplies-across-southern-africa-27-03-2024 ). And in fact, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe have published reports indicating a potential decline in grain harvest because of intense El Nino dryness. Given that these countries are amongst the largest maize producers within the Southern Africa region, a potential decline in the harvest in these countries suggest there could be an increase in the risk of food security [11](https://theconversation.com/dry-weather-hits-southern-africas-farmers-putting-key-maize-supplies-at-risk-how-to-blunt-the-impact-224974 ).

In fact, El Niño induced drought is likely to force southern Africa to import grain  [12](https://theconversation.com/dry-weather-hits-southern-africas-farmers-putting-key-maize-supplies-at-risk-how-to-blunt-the-impact-224974 ) [13](https://english.news.cn/africa/20240323/830961233ba4424baede664973c2f144/c.html ) .  The field crops are primarily rainfed. For example, only about 20% of maize, 15% of soybean, and 34% of sugarcane are produced under irrigation, leaving a large part of the crop area at the mercy of the rains, which have been scarce since the start of February [14](https://www.agbiz.co.za/content/open/04-march-2024-sa-agri-market-viewpoint-414 ).

####  Latin America and the Caribbean: maize, beans and coffee

In parts of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, below average rainfall is expected, adversely affecting agricultural products of maize, beans and coffee, exacerbating food insecurity and economic hardships for communities reliant on agriculture. Countries like Bolivia and Colombia prolonged droughts and water shortages are anticipated, impacting agricultural production and livelihoods [15](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-food-security-alert-strong-el-nino-event-will-contribute-high-food-assistance-needs-through-2024-october-3-2023  )  **of XXX, YYY and ZZZ..**

Maize production and harvest suffered considerable declines in Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela, with a considerable decline from June to March which resulted in increased prices and affected food security in 2023 [16](https://www.undrr.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/en-el-nino-event-in-the-americas-and-the-caribbean-2023.pdf ). Therefore the impact of El Nino on food security in this region has significant repercussions, affecting approximately 40 million people within the humanitarian coverage area of the World Food Programme (WFP)[17](https://www.undrr.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/en-el-nino-event-in-the-americas-and-the-caribbean-2023.pdf ).

#### Southeast Asia: rice production heavily affected

According to a recent study [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308521X22002001), around 13.4% of the world’s rice fields were affected by past El Niño events, particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India. Combined, India, Thailand and Vietnam account for more than half global rice exports (approximately 21, 6 and 5 million tonnes respectively in 2021) [19](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home ). Production declines will have huge implications on supply of rice not only in Southeast Asia but across the world, particularly in West Asia and Africa. Rice production, like most of the agriculture, is highly dependent on favourable climatic conditions. During March-May 2023 when temperatures rose above 45 °C in Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, and above 40°C  in Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia [20](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/environment/asia-heatwave-05182023020840.html ), the rice planting season was delayed because of high temperaturen [21](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2023-53-rice-production-and-food-security-in-southeast-asia-under-threat-from-el-nino-by-elyssa-ludher-and-paul-teng/ ) and low precipitation [22]( https://doc-isolation-prod.prod.fire.glass/api/wopi/downloads/docisolation-viewer/?fileAccessId=70c2193b-c6ae-4013-9551-42698653df26&password=false&statusCode=1000&operationRestriction=3), which are typical climatic impacts of El Niño in Southeast Asia. Delaying the planting season due to extreme heat is a measure to prevent heat stress during critical growth stages [23](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/5/1339 ), and a form of climate change adaptation aiming to maximize yields. Generally, temperatures above 33°C have commonly resulted in rice yield reductions [24](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.03.011 ).

One study by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines has found that for every 1°C  increase in average night-time temperatures during the dry season, there was a corresponding gloss of 10% of yield on average [25]. With El Niño recording-breaking temperatures, yields of rice were affected. Thailand's 2023 wet season rice harvested area and yield were severely affected mainly by the heat wave and drought caused by El Niño during June to August and flood damage in September 2023, with total production down by 5.3% compared to normal year [26](https://doc-isolation-prod.prod.fire.glass/api/wopi/downloads/docisolation-viewer/?fileAccessId=f649d126-919e-4d09-bfb9-c5b9b4fbfa80&password=false&statusCode=1000&operationRestriction=3).
