## El Niño 2023-2024: impacts on food security

***The 2023–2024 El Niño has peaked as one of the five strongest on record. This story is part 3 of a series dedicated to its impacts. [Part 1](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes) focuses on record-breaking land surface temperatures, heatwaves, and nighttime temperatures, while [Part 2](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=sea-surface-temperature-rise) focuses on global sea surface temperature rises and marine heatwaves.***
 

The recent El Niño, which dissipated by mid-2024 [[1]]( https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity) had both positive and negative impacts on global food security. Some agriculture regions experienced severe flooding,  while others faced drought conditions due to reduced rainfall caused by El Niño. These contrasting impacts significantly affected agricultural yields and altered trade flows during the 2023-2024 seasons [[2]]( https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/agriculture/061523-factbox-mapping-el-ninos-impact-on-crop-yields-global-food-trade-in-2023-24 ), according to agricultural institutions, meteorological agencies and trade analysts. As El Niño intensified in 2023, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) forecasted mixed consequences on food security [[3]](https://agrilinks.org/post/el-nino-strengthens-famine-early-warning-systems-network-forecasts-mixed-impacts-food-security ). High levels of acute food insecurity were anticipated in certain regions, and [FEWS NET projections](https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/fews) indicated that approximately 105-110 million people across 31 regions would require food assistance due to weather extremes, conflicts, and economic disruptions [[4]]( https://agrilinks.org/post/el-nino-strengthens-famine-early-warning-systems-network-forecasts-mixed-impacts-food-security ) [[5]](https://fews.net/our-services/food-assistance-outlook-briefs ).

The negative impacts were primarily related to heat stress, which caused crops to lose water, delayed their growth, reduced pollination efficiency, impaired seeding and root development, caused leaves to wither or turn yellow, decreased the number of tillers (grain-bearing branches), and even led to the death of the seedlings [[6]](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2023-53-rice-production-and-food-security-in-southeast-asia-under-threat-from-el-nino-by-elyssa-ludher-and-paul-teng/ ).

#### Southern Africa: impacts on maize and corn crops
Maize is the single most important cereal crop in Southern Africa, accounting for nearly 70% of the regions’ cereal production. During previous El Niño events, maize production typically declined by 10-15% relative to expected yields [[7]](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity ). Similarly, during the 2023-2024 El Niño, below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures negatively affected crop yields, particularly staple foods like maize, in countries such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, and South Africa [[8]](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-food-security-alert-strong-el-nino-event-will-contribute-high-food-assistance-needs-through-2024-october-3-2023) [[9]]( https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152005/el-nino-forecast-to-contribute-to-food-insecurity). Recent forecasts estimated declines in corn production for the 2024-2025 season, espeically in in Zambia and South Africa, two of the region's largest corn producers, where yields are projected to drop by 41.8% and 9.1%, respectively [[10]](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/agribusiness/el-nino-linked-declines-corn-production-south-africa-and-zambia-tighten-supplies-across-southern-africa-27-03-2024). Indeed, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe reported potential reductions in grain harvest due to intense dryness linked to El Nino. Given their status as major maize producers in Southern Africa, declines in these countries' harvests influence the risk of food security across the region [[11]](https://theconversation.com/dry-weather-hits-southern-africas-farmers-putting-key-maize-supplies-at-risk-how-to-blunt-the-impact-224974).

</center>

In fact, drought conditions induced by El Niño impact Southern Africa's volume of grain imports  [[12]](https://theconversation.com/dry-weather-hits-southern-africas-farmers-putting-key-maize-supplies-at-risk-how-to-blunt-the-impact-224974 ) [[13]](https://english.news.cn/africa/20240323/830961233ba4424baede664973c2f144/c.html ), as most of the region's field crops depend heavily on rainfall, with only about 20% of maize, 15% of soybean, and 34% of sugarcane are produced under irrigation, and a large part of the crop area is vulnerable to rainfall variability, which has been scarce since early February 2024 [[14]](https://www.agbiz.co.za/content/open/04-march-2024-sa-agri-market-viewpoint-414 ). 

#### GEOGLAM Crop Conditions Map
On the map, the [GEOGLAM Global Crop Monitor dataset](https://www.cropmonitor.org/) illustrates the crop conditions in **February 2024**. Poor crop conditions are observed in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique due to the prolongued dry spell which occurred during a time when typically seasonal rains are high.  

The GEOGLAM Global Crop Monitor dataset uses a combination of remote sensing data like global precipitation and soil moisture measurements to help reduce uncertainty, promote market transparency, and provide early warning for crop failures through multi-agency collaboration.

####  Latin America and the Caribbean: maize, beans and coffee

In parts of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), below average rainfall was anticipated during the 2023-2024 El Niño event, negatively impacting agricultural products such as maize, beans and coffee. This situation intensified food insecurity and economic difficulties for communities heavily dependent on agriculture. Countries like Bolivia and Colombia experienced prolonged droughts and water shortages, significantly affecting agricultural production and local livelihoods [[15]](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-food-security-alert-strong-el-nino-event-will-contribute-high-food-assistance-needs-through-2024-october-3-2023).

Maize production and harvest declined significantly in Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela from June 2023 through March 2024. These production losses led to higher food prices and negatively impacted food security throughout 2023 [[16]](https://www.undrr.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/en-el-nino-event-in-the-americas-and-the-caribbean-2023.pdf). Consequently, the effects of El Nino had major repercussions on food security in the region, affecting approximately 40 million people within the humanitarian coverage area of the World Food Programme (WFP)[[17]](https://www.undrr.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/en-el-nino-event-in-the-americas-and-the-caribbean-2023.pdf).

#### GEOGLAM Crop Conditions Map
The map shows the [GEOGLAM Global Crop Monitor dataset](https://www.cropmonitor.org/) over the region of Latin America and the Caribbean in **January 2024**. For maize, favourable conditions are visible in South America, with dry conditions visile in Central America. Further impacts are visible in Brazil for soybeans, with favourable conditions in Argentina for the same crop.

#### Southeast Asia impacts on rice production

According to a recent study [[18]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308521X22002001), around 13.4% of the world’s rice fields were affected by past El Niño events, particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India. Combined, India, Thailand and Vietnam accounted for more than half global rice exports (approximately 21, 6 and 5 million tonnes respectively in 2021) [[19]](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home ). Production declines in these countries significantly impacted the global rice supply, affecting not only in Southeast Asia but also regions such as West Asia and Africa. Rice production, like most agricultural activities, is highly dependent on favourable climatic conditions. Between March and May 2023, temperatures rose above 45 °C in Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, and exceeded 40°C  in Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia [[20]](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/environment/asia-heatwave-05182023020840.html ), delaying rice planting due to extreme heat [[21]](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2023-53-rice-production-and-food-security-in-southeast-asia-under-threat-from-el-nino-by-elyssa-ludher-and-paul-teng/ ) and low precipitation [[22]]( https://doc-isolation-prod.prod.fire.glass/api/wopi/downloads/docisolation-viewer/?fileAccessId=70c2193b-c6ae-4013-9551-42698653df26&password=false&statusCode=1000&operationRestriction=3) — typical climatic impacts of El Niño in Southeast Asia. Delaying planting to avoid heat stress during critical growth stages [[23]](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/5/1339 ) is a climate adaptation strategy aimed at maximising yields. Generally, temperatures above 33°C have been associated with reductions in rice yields [[24]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.03.011 ).

#### GEOGLAM Crop Conditions Map
The map shows the [GEOGLAM Global Crop Monitor dataset](https://www.cropmonitor.org/) over the region Southeast Asia in **August 2023**, showing mixed conditions for rice, with dry and hot conditions in China, delayed rains in India and drought and damage from pests and disease in Thailand.


A study conducted by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines has found that for every 1°C  increase in average nighttime temperatures during the dry season, rice yields decreased by approximately 10% [[21]](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/iseas-perspective/2023-53-rice-production-and-food-security-in-southeast-asia-under-threat-from-el-nino-by-elyssa-ludher-and-paul-teng/). With recording-breaking temperatures brought by the 2023 El Niño, rice yields suffered significantly. Thailand's 2023 wet season rice harvested area and yield were severely affected mainly by the heat waves and drought conditions from June to August, as well as flood damage in September. As a result, total rice production decreased by 5.3% compared to an average year [[25]](https://doc-isolation-prod.prod.fire.glass/api/wopi/downloads/docisolation-viewer/?fileAccessId=f649d126-919e-4d09-bfb9-c5b9b4fbfa80&password=false&statusCode=1000&operationRestriction=3).


## Open Science datasets
Satellite earth observations provide valuable datasets enabling large-scale and near-real-time crop monitoring, which supports informed decision-making and agricultural planning. This capability plays a crucial role in promoting food security and environmental sustainability. 

Space agencies including ESA, NASA and JAXA, offer access to these datasets, providing farmers, researchers, and policymakers with critical insights. Below are some notable satellite-based, open-access datasets dedicated to crop monitoring:

- [GEOGALM: Global Crop Monitoring](https://www.cropmonitor.org/) - This initiative provides open, timely, and scientifically-driven information on crop conditions, aimed at improving market transparency and enabling early warnings for potential production shortfalls. GEOGLAM compiles data from  [multiple sources](https://www.cropmonitor.org/eo-data), including satellite, aerial, and other platforms, at varying spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions, significantly enhancing global agricultural monitoring. The maps featured in this article's visualizations are sourced from the **[GEOGLAM dataset on EO Dashboard](https://eodashboard.org/explore?indicator=N6&x=0&y=-1931326.10533&z=1.69697)**.

- [ESA WorldCereal](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/products/global-maps) - In 2023 ESA WorldCereal released the first dynamic system to provide cropland and crop type maps at 10 meter spatial resolution. The WorldCereal consortium succeeded in providing detailed and seasonally updated global maps of temporary crops, crop type (maize, winter cereals and spring cereals) and irrigation for the year 2021. In the process, WorldCereal also released a fully open, harmonized database of in-situ reference data related to land cover, crop type and irrigation. [WorldCereal products can be explored on the TerraScope platform](https://viewer.terrascope.be/?language=en&bbox=0.3988039121031764,48.12662501317999,8.836303912103176,53.27692852445625&overlay=true&bgLayer=OSM&date=2025-03-28&layer=terrascope-s2-toc-v2_tci)

- [NASA ECOSTRESS](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/ecostress/) and the [European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH)](https://ecostresshub.eu/) - NASA's ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station) mission accurately measures the temperature of plants on Earth's surface,  acquiring diurnal earth surface temperature images at a spatial resolution of 70 m. Plants regulate their temperature through the release of water vapor via tiny leaf pores called stomata. When water availability is sufficient, plants maintain stable temperatures. However, under water stress, plant temperatures rise—changes detectable by ECOSTRESS, providing valuable insights into crop water stress and health. The [European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH)](https://ecostresshub.eu/) generates continental-scale develops land surface temperature (LST) and evaporation (ET) products for Europe and Africa using high spatial and temporal resolution information from the ECOSTRESS mission.

- [JASMAI](https://jasmai.maff.go.jp/en/) from JAXA and  MAFF/Japan (Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fishery) - JASMAI provides visualization of weather and vegetation data such as soil moisture content, precipitation, and NDVI, etc. for each country and area in the main production zones of major cereals and other crops obtained from satellite observations mainly by JAXA. The information provided by JASMIN is referred in the monthly [Rice Growing Outlook (RGO)](https://asia-rice.org/rice-growing-outlook/) report published by the [ASEAN Food Security Information System (AFSIS)](https://aptfsis.org/publication/rgo).

- Food and Agriculture Data [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) - provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories and covers all FAO regional groupings
from 1961 to the most recent year available.
