### Unprecedented Antarctic Sea Ice Decline in 2023: Record Lows and Historic Anomalies <!--{ style="font-size:1rem;opacity:0.7;margin-top:1rem;height:200px;" }-->

## Record-low Antarctic Sea ice in 2023
While the global temperature records in 2023 made many headlines, also some remarkable events and record breaking events took place in the Antarctic. On 16 February 2023, the Copernicus Marine Service recorded a new record decline in sea ice coverage around Antarctica, standing at just 1.77 million km2 [1](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/antarctic-summer-sea-ice-minimum-lowest-ever-observed), which was 36% less than the 1979-2022 average daily minimum. Since then, the Antarctic sea ice continued to drop to record lows in May and June 2023, particularly in the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and the Ross Sea's western part (visualized below) [2](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/2023-northern-hemisphere-summer-record-breaking-oceanic-events). Following the summer minimum, the Antarctic sea ice coverage remained exceptionally low during the autumn and winter growth, which led to the largest negative anomaly in areal extent ever observed (with satellites) - meaning that, new records were set for both the annual minimum in February  and also the annual maximum in September [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00961-9). On September 24th, the Antarctic sea ice reached its annual maximum extent of 16.96 million km2 setting a new record low maximum in the satellite record (i.e. since 1979) [4](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/2023-antarctic-sea-ice-winter-maximum-lowest-record-wide-margin ).

Low sea ice conditions in the Southern Ocean can not be attributed to a single cause, but [El Niño](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes) could have partly contributed to this. Historically, large-scale climate patterns, such as ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode, have contributed to the ups-and-downs observed in the annual change of Antarctic sea ice, by either amplifying or suppressing sea ice changes, by affecting the ways that sea ice moves, melts and freezes. Multiple factors combined could be responsible for these lows observed in 2023. Recent studies [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00624-1) have pointed to the important role of ocean processes and heat stored in ocean waters below the surface, which for instance kept sea-ice extent low since 2016. The warm sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean during the first half of 2023 could also partly explain both the record minimum extent in February and the slow freeze-up afterwards. Although it may not be possible to associate the record Antarctic sea ice lows with ENSO, recent observations suggest that ENSO impacts basal melting of West Antarctic ice shelves, suggesting that Antarctic sea-ice extent has likely been exacerbated by the developing El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean [6](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL104518). This development in Antarctica shows a concerning deviation from previous trends, since Antarctica sea-ice extent has held relatively steady against progressing climate change, contrary to its counterpart in the Arctic.

## Antarctic Winter Sea-ice Extent Lowest Ever Recorded
In the Arctic, the North American and Eurasian continents encircle the Arctic Ocean, while in the Antarctic, the Southern Ocean surrounds Antarctica. Both the Arctic and Southern Oceans show seasonal variations, with sea ice expanding as seawater freezes in winter and retreating as sea ice melts in summer. When we think of “Antarctic ice”, the first thing that comes to mind may be the continental ice sheet formed by snow accumulation, but there are also areas of floating frozen seawater - sea ice - that surround the continent, and provide a stage for the development of ecosystems. Sea ice extent and thickness is used as an indicator of climate change because it is affected by both air and water temperatures. By utilizing satellite microwave radiometers such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer [(AMSR) series](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/AMSR/index_en.html) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager ([SSM/I](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/dmsp-microwave-imager)), it is possible to observe not only seasonal variations in sea-ice extent but also long-term trends spanning over 45 years, from 1978 to the present.

The figure below shows the seasonal changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent for the past three decades, derived from these passive microwave observations. Because the seasons are reversed in the northern and southern hemispheres, the Arctic (Antarctic) sea ice cover reaches a minimum (maximum) in September (hereinafter referred to as “summer” Arctic sea-ice extent and “winter” Antarctic sea-ice extent). The Arctic region experienced sea ice decline from the 1990s through the 2010s, with the smallest summer sea-ice extent on record in 2012. As shown in the right figure, the Antarctic sea ice extent usually begins to increase around March, with sea-ice extent peaking during September and October. Antarctic sea ice extent showed almost the same seasonal variation until the 2010s. However, in 2023, the sea-ice extent from March to September was consistently below the historical average.

#### Month comparison: June 2023
Let’s take a closer look at where sea-ice extent expansion has been weaker than usual in June and September 2023. As shown in the figure below, Antarctica is encircled by the Southern Ocean, with the Bellingshausen Sea on the left, the Weddell Sea on the top, and Ross Sea on the bottom. Comparing sea-ice extent in these areas with  the average from the past 45 years (white line), we can see that the south-to-north sea ice extent is significantly decreased in June.

#### ... and September 2023
Three months later, in September, when sea-ice extent is at its yearly maximum, the Bellingshausen Sea has recovered to levels similar to previous years, but the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and other areas continue to exhibit a generally low sea-ice extent.

#### A potential factor contributing to the low sea-ice extent in winter 2023
Although the cause of the significantly smaller Antarctic winter sea-ice extent in 2023 compared to previous years is still unknown, one possible factor is that the heat stored in the ocean (ocean heat content) due to the ongoing summer sea ice retreat since around 2016 has slowed sea ice production. In particular, if there is less sea ice in the summer than in an average year, the sea surface is exposed to more solar radiation and absorbs more of it. This increases the ocean heat content, decreasing the formation of sea ice in autumn and winter. In this way, the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the ocean increases with the exposed open water fractions, leading to the further decrease in sea ice. This effect is known as the “sea ice/ocean albedo feedback” (albedo: ratio of the energy of reflected light to the energy of incident sunlight).

## Changes in Antarctc sea-ice extent
Let us look at the interannual variability of the Antarctic summer sea-ice extent. The figure below shows the minimum sea-ice extent for the month of February derived from microwave radiometer data. As mentioned above, sea-ice extent in the Arctic Ocean has been on a decreasing trend, while in the Southern Ocean it has been on a slightly increasing trend until about 2015. In any case, the long-term trend in the Antarctic sea-ice extent has not been as dramatic as in the Arctic and has not received as much attention.
The trend in Antarctic sea-ice extent began to change in the early austral spring of 2016 (around November). Higher sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean and warm air advected from the north led to a decrease in sea-ice extent [7](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL073656) [8](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074691) [9](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098904), with a record minimum in February 2017, as shown in the figure below. 

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>


The higher ocean surface temperatures are thought to be the result of a combination of changes in two “climate modes (see Supplement 1)”: the remote “El Niño-Southern Oscillation” and the more local “Southern Annular Mode” [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2751). Although it has been considered that the 2017 minimum may have been triggered by a short-term event, sea-ice extent has consistently remained low since then, reaching new record minimums in 2022 and 2023. A recent study [11] suggest that the dramatic decline in Antarctic sea ice, which began in 2016, may be primarily due to long-term warming of the Southern Ocean associated with greenhouse gas emissions [12](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00961-9). The Antarctic sea-ice extent reached the yearly minimum on 18th February 2024, marking the second lowest in the satellite observation era, following February 2023 [13](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/earthview/2024/03/05/7973/index.html).

## Impacts of Antarctic sea ice loss

#### Wildlife breeding 
What would happen if Antarctic sea ice were to begin to decline at a significant rate? Regarding the impact on ecosystems, we would like to introduce a study on a colony of emperor penguins published in Communications Earth & Environment, a journal in the field of earth and planetary sciences [14](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00927-x). Emperor penguins lay their eggs from May to June on landfast sea ice (sea ice that is attached to the shore and does not move), and the hatched chicks fledge during December and January. Therefore, for successful breeding, the landfast ice must be stable from winter to early spring. However, in 2022, when spring sea-ice extent was at an all-time low, it was reported that four of the five colonies had lost all their Emperor penguin chicks due to the loss of landfast ice in the Bellingshausen Sea.

#### Ice shelf melting and sea level rise
What about the impact on the oceans? As mentioned at the beginning of this article, Antarctica is covered by a thick layer of ice, up to 4000 m thick, called an ice sheet. Ice sheets gradually flow toward the sea under their own weight. At the coast, sections of the ice sheet begin to float, forming ice shelves (ice that is attached to land and floats in the sea). Since ice shelves are in contact with seawater at their base and front, higher temperatures in the Southern Ocean, due to sea ice loss, may contribute to accelerated ice shelf melting and iceberg calving. This may reduce the resistive force ice shelves exert on the flow of the upstream grounded ice sheet and thereby increase the ice-sheet  contribution to sea level rise [15](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/647/2013/). This resistive force may also be reduced by the loss of landfast sea ice at ice shelf fronts [16](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-427-2017)[17](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-5789-2024).
