## Record-low Antarctic Sea ice in 2023
While global temperature records in 2023 made headlines, some remarkable events and record breaking events also occurred in Antarctica. On 16 February 2023, the Copernicus Marine Service recorded a new low in Antarctic sea ice coverage, which fell to just 1.77 million km2 [1](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/antarctic-summer-sea ice-minimum-lowest-ever-observed) - 36% below the 1979-2022 average daily minimum. Since then, Antarctic sea ice has continued to decline, reaching record lows in May and June 2023, particularly in the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and the Ross Sea's western part (as shown below) [2](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/2023-northern-hemisphere-summer-record-breaking-oceanic-events). Following the summer minimum, the Antarctic sea ice coverage remained exceptionally low during the autumn and winter growth period, resulting in the largest negative anomaly in areal extent ever observed by satellites. This means that new records were set for both the annual minimum in February  and also the annual maximum in September [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00961-9). On September 24th, Antarctic sea ice reached its annual maximum extent of 16.96 million km2 setting a new record low maximum in the satellite record (i.e. since 1979) [4](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/2023-antarctic-sea ice-winter-maximum-lowest-record-wide-margin ).

Low sea ice conditions in the Southern Ocean cannot be attributed to a single cause, but [El Niño](https://eodashboard.org/story?id=el-nino-extremes) may have played a contributing role. Historically, large-scale climate patterns like ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode have influenced the annual fluctuations in Antarctic sea ice by either amplifying or suppressing changes, affecting how sea ice moves, melts and freezes. The record lows observed in 2023 could have been driven by a combination of factors. Recent studies [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00624-1) highlighted the important role of ocean processes and heat stored in subsurface ocean waters, which have contributed to reduced sea ice extent since 2016. Warm sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean during the first half of 2023 may also partly explain both the record minimum extent in February and the slow freeze-up that followed. While it may not be possible to directly link the record lows in Antarctic sea ice to ENSO, recent observations suggest that ENSO impacts basal melting of West Antarctic ice shelves, indicating that the developing El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean [6](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL104518) have likely worsened the decline in Antarctic sea ice extent. This trend in Antarctica shows a concerning deviation from previous patterns, as Antarctica sea ice extent has historically remained relatively stable despite ongoing climate change, in contrast to the more rapid decline seen in the Arctic.

## Antarctic Winter sea ice Extent Lowest Ever Recorded
In the Arctic, the North American and Eurasian continents encircle the Arctic Ocean, while in the Antarctic, the Southern Ocean surrounds Antarctica. Both the Arctic and Southern Oceans show seasonal variations, with sea ice expanding as seawater freezes in winter and retreating as sea ice melts in summer. When we think of “Antarctic ice”, the first thing that often comes to mind is the continental ice sheet formed by snow accumulation. However, large areas of floating frozen seawater - sea ice - also surround the continent, providing a foundation for ecosystem development. Sea ice extent and thickness are indicators of climate change because they are influenced by both air and water temperatures. Using satellite microwave radiometers such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer [(AMSR) series](https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/AMSR/index_en.html) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager ([SSM/I](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/dmsp-microwave-imager)), scientists can observe not only seasonal variations in sea ice extent but also long-term trends spanning over 45 years, from 1978 to the present.

The figure below shows the seasonal changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent for the past three decades, derived from these passive microwave observations. Since the seasons are reversed in the northern and southern hemispheres, the Arctic (Antarctic) sea ice cover reaches a minimum (maximum) in September (hereinafter referred to as “summer” Arctic sea ice extent and “winter” Antarctic sea ice extent). The Arctic region experienced sea ice decline from the 1990s through the 2010s, with the smallest summer sea ice extent on record in 2012. As shown in the second figure below, the Antarctic sea ice extent typically begins to increase around March, peaking during September and October, with relatively stable seasonal patterns until the 2010s. However, in 2023, the sea ice extent from March to September remained consistently below the historical average.

#### Month comparison: June 2023
Let’s take a closer look at where sea ice extent expanded less than usual in June and September 2023. As illustrated in the figure below, Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean, with the Bellingshausen Sea on the left, the Weddell Sea at the top, and Ross Sea at the bottom. By comparing sea ice extent in these areas to the average of the past 45 years (white line), we can see a significant decrease of the south-to-north sea ice extent during June.

#### A potential factor contributing to the low sea ice extent in winter 2023
Although the cause of the significantly smaller Antarctic winter sea ice extent in 2023 compared to previous years is still unknown, one possible factor is the increased heat stored in the ocean (ocean heat content). The ongoing retreat of summer sea ice since approximately 2016 has slowed sea ice production. In particular, if there is less sea ice in the summer than in an average year, the sea surface is exposed to more solar radiation and absorbs more of it. This increases the ocean heat content, decreasing the formation of sea ice in autumn and winter. In this way, the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the ocean increases with the exposed open water fractions, leading to the further decrease in sea ice. This effect is known as the “sea ice/ocean albedo feedback” (albedo: ratio of the energy of reflected light to the energy of incident sunlight).

## Changes in Antarctc sea ice extent
Let's examine the interannual variability of Antarctic summer sea ice extent. The figure below shows the minimum sea ice extent for February derived from microwave radiometer data. As previously noted, sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean has been on a decreasing trend, while the Southern Ocean experienced a slight increasing trend until around 2015. In any case, the long-term trend in the Antarctic sea ice extent has not been as dramatic as in the Arctic and thus received less attention.
The trend began to change in the early austral spring of 2016 (around November). Higher sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean and warm air advected from the north led to a decrease in sea ice extent [7](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GL073656) [8](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074691) [9](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098904), reaching a record minimum in February 2017, as shown in the figure below. 

<figure style="text-align: center;">

</figure>


The higher ocean surface temperatures are thought to be the result of a combination of changes in two “climate modes (see Supplement 1)”: the remote “El Niño-Southern Oscillation” and the more local “Southern Annular Mode” [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2751). Although it has been considered that the 2017 minimum may have been triggered by a short-term event, sea ice extent has consistently remained low since then, reaching new record minimums in 2022 and 2023. A recent study [11] suggest that the dramatic decline in Antarctic sea ice, which began in 2016, may be primarily due to long-term warming of the Southern Ocean associated with greenhouse gas emissions [12](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00961-9). The Antarctic sea ice extent reached the yearly minimum on 18th February 2024, marking the second lowest in the satellite observation era, following February 2023 [13](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/earthview/2024/03/05/7973/index.html).

## Impacts of Antarctic sea ice loss

#### Wildlife breeding 
What might happen if Antarctic sea ice began declining significantly? To understand the potential impact on ecosystems, let's consider a study on a colony of emperor penguins published in Communications Earth & Environment, a journal focused on earth and planetary sciences [14](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00927-x). Emperor penguins lay their eggs from May to June on landfast sea ice (sea ice attached to the shore and not moving), and the hatched chicks fledge during December and January. Stable landfast ice from winter to early spring is therefore crucial for successful breeding. However, in 2022, when spring sea ice extent was at an all-time low, four of the five colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea lost all their Emperor penguin chicks due to the early breakup of this essential ice habitat.

#### Ice shelf melting and sea level rise
What about the impact on the oceans? As mentioned at the start of this article, Antarctica is covered by a thick layer of ice, up to 4000 m thick, called an ice sheet. Ice sheets gradually flow toward the sea under their own weight. At the coast, sections of the ice sheet begin to float, forming ice shelves (ice that is attached to land and floats in the sea). Since ice shelves are in contact with seawater at their base and front, higher temperatures in the Southern Ocean due to sea ice loss may contribute to accelerated ice shelf melting and iceberg calving. This may reduce the resistive force ice shelves exert on the flow of the upstream grounded ice sheet and thereby increase the ice-sheet  contribution to sea level rise [15](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/7/647/2013/). This resistive force may also be reduced by the loss of landfast sea ice at ice shelf fronts [16](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-427-2017)[17](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-5789-2024).
