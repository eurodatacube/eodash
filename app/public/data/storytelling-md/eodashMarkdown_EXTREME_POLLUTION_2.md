# Extreme air pollution episodes in Northern India and Pakistan in 2023
######  [This story is based on results from the [3RD EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE CHALLENGE ]( https://sciencehub.esa.int/2024/05/09/3rd-earth-system-science-challenge/). The notebook can be acceed at GitHub.]
Air pollution is a real concern for human health (breathing difficulties, cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc). According to World Health Organization (WHO), outdoor air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions.

###  Indo Gangetic Plain: one of the Worlds' most populated and polluted regions in the world

##
The Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP), which comprises northern India and Pakistan, is one of the most densely populated regions in the world and one of the world/s most dynamic regions in the sectors of agriculture and industry. Unfortunately, the region also presents high levels of pollutans which impact thair quality - being often reported severe pollution episodes. For example, in November 2023, due to a particular severe pollution epsiode, local authorities were forced to to close schools in major Indian cities such as New Delhi.

## Detecting severe air pollution with satellite data
In this challenge, the authors aimed at studying the number of extreme air pollution episodes for the year of 2023 for one pollutant in 3 major cities of the IGP, namely: Lahore, New Delhi and Lucknow. Once the episodes were identified, the authors attempet at understanding and explain the formation of a pollution episode, in particular the one in November 2023 and describing its evolution over time, bum using multiple sources of satellite imagery. 

The pollutant studied was carbon monoxide (CO). CO is a key atmospheric pollutant that is closely monitored in the domain of air quality for it:s role of pollution tracer. Indeed, CO is emitted during incomplete combustion processes linked to anthropogenic activities and vegetation burning. It has a lifetime of few days to few months (depending on seasons and latitudes). Here, the authors used CO concentrations retrieved with the TROPOMI instrument, onboard of Copernicus Sentinel-5P. TROPOMI has a global coverage of 1 day, which can help us to study the daily variation of CO anywhere on the globe.
## S-5P <!--{as="img" src="https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/documents/247904/4845691/ESA_Sentinel+5P_infographic_2.PNG" style="width: 80%; height: 600px;"}-->


## Methodology: time series of daily CO over cities
For each city it was generated  a rectangle of -0.4 to 0.4° of longitude and -0.4 to 0.4° latitude (from the given coordinates of the chosen city in latitude and longitude) which corresponds to -39.8 to 39.8km in longitude and to -44.5 to 44.5km in latitude. Then the computed time series of each day is the average value of all CO concentration values measured by TROPOMI within that rectangle (with a resolution of 0.025°). The percentile method is a strategy utilized to recognize outliers or extreme values based upon a defined percent limit. It involves calculating the threshold values based on percentiles and the steps are to first determine the percentage threshold (like 90%, 95%, and 99% in our case), then calculate the threshold values, and then identify outliers and extreme values above this threshold.

##
### Results: the daily variation of CO (for 2023)
The figures display the time series of daily concentration of CO in Lahore, New Delhi and Lucknow. In each of the figures, the yellow line indicates the 90% percentile extreme, the blue one, the 95% percentile extreme, and the green one, the 99% percentile extreme. The points above these lines are the extreme events resulted form the percentile technique.  What can be noticed here is that the extreme events seem to happen at the same time for the 3 cities especially for 99% percentile extremes (at the end of October-November). Furthermore, when these extreme episodes were quantified the, the number of days which are considered extremes were almost the same for the 3 cities so there might be a correlation between the extreme pollution events in the 3 cities. We must note that the total number of days in 2023 is not 365 since for some days we do not have measurements because of clouds or other factors.

#### Sharp increase of CO
The authors noticed a sharp increase at the end of October of CO. Those emissions seemed to be spontaneous, so they can be linked to unusual antropogenic activities or vegetation fires.

#### First peak - New Dehli
The first peak in CO was detected in New Delhi on 11/04. Indeed, once CO had accumulated, the wind generally blew towards the southeast from where the fires were detected (see previous slide). Being the closest city to the fires (in the southeast direction), New Delhi experiences the first peak in CO concentration.

#### ... Second peak - Lahore
The second peak in CO was detected in Lahore on 11/07. This can be explained by the fact that wind speed was very low in the city and the region of the fires: CO then accumulated again, further increasing the CO concentration, which was already high due to the accumulation around 10/30; ​

#### ...Last peak in CO in Lucknow, far from burning sources!
The last peak in CO was detected in Lucknow. This city is far from the region where agricultural waste was burned: it took several days of wind blowing towards the southeast from the fire region for the CO concentration to be elevated in Lucknow.

#### Observing the fires...
The high concentration of CO could be linked to antrophogenic sources, like the burning of vegetation.
In order to observe theses fires, the authors used the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument embarked on the Suomi-NPP satellite. This imager has a spatial resolution of 375m and a swath width of 3000, which helps to monitor small fires around the world. They used day and night time data, which allowed to show the location of fires detected by VIIRS during the month of October and November 2023 in the IGP. The number of fires increased  over this period, which could explain the rise of CO concentrations. 

We have to note that the VIIRS Active Fires data can only give us a hint on the location of the fires and not their lifetime and their size. Indeed, a small temporary fire is counted in the same way as a large fire lasting over time. Plus, VIIRS uses optical data, so the presence of clouds disrupts observations.

#### 
Finally, we notice that the city of Lucknow is not close to fire sources, yet it is indeed impacted by these episodes of extreme pollution. So, the presence of fires may not be the only contributor to this pollution event, another parameter must be taken into account, especially local meteorology.

#### ... and observing the wind!
Another variable behind the CO concentrations detected in each of this cities could be the wind direction. 

In order to understand why Lucknow, which is quite a distance from the fires detected by VIIRS, is experiencing high concentrations of CO, like those detected in New Delhi or Lahore, the authors also looked at the meterology data, since these high concentrations could be explained by the transport by the winds. To this end they used use ERA5 reanalyses. By averaging the horizontal winds at 100m for each day, at UTC+05, it was possible to analize the evolution of wind direction and speed from October 25th to November 14th. In general, wind speed was low during this period. However, it was also noticed a change in wind direction around October 30th: the wind, which was blowing towards the southeast, shifted towards the west around this date. As a result, CO, being trapped against the Pakistani terrain and the Himalayas, accumulated, thus explaining the high levels of CO shown in the time series.
