# El Niño 2023-2024 (Part 2): Rising Global Sea Surface Temperatures

In the past, natural factors were the primary drivers of El Niño and La Niña cycles. However, human activity, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, is now influencing these climate patterns. Recent studies [1] suggest that climate change is making both El Niño and La Niña more frequent and more intense [2]. These shifts are already having widespread consequences, affecting an estimated 40 to 50 million people across 16 countries [3], especially in regions like eastern and southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Asia-Pacific.
	
El Niño brings extreme weather conditions such as severe droughts, heavy rains, flooding, and high temperatures. These events contribute to food insecurity, disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and heat-related illnesses, highlighting the profound impact climate patterns have on human health and well-being [4].

Understanding these changes is crucial for preparing and responding to climate impacts, and this is where Earth observation plays a pivotal role. Satellites and other remote sensing tools provided by space agencies such as JAXA, ESA and NASA provide continuous monitoring of the planet, offering scientists real-time data on sea surface temperatures (SST), weather patterns, and environmental changes. By analysing this data, researchers can detect early signs of El Niño or La Niña and predict their potential impacts, improving disaster preparedness and response efforts. Earth observation systems have become an indispensable tool in climate science, helping us better understand and mitigate the effects of a warming planet.

## Europe's Marine Heatwave

Marine heatwaves, characterised by unusually high ocean temperatures, are another pressing concern. These events can severely disrupt marine ecosystems, endangering biodiversity and affecting industries like fisheries, tourism, and aquaculture. In the summer of 2023, regions across Europe and Asia experienced significant marine heatwaves, as reported by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The North Atlantic and the Mediterranean were hit particularly hard, leading to extreme sea surface temperature anomalies [5].

The situation was especially alarming in the waters around Ireland and the United Kingdom, where sea temperatures soared to 5°C above average in June 2023. Across European waters, 2023 recorded the highest average sea surface temperatures ever documented, with parts of the Mediterranean Sea and northeastern Atlantic reaching unprecedented levels [6].

This map illustrates the **Ocean Heat Content (OHC300)** for June 2023. This variable, provided by ECMWF, measures the amount of heat stored in the upper 300 meters of the ocean, providing important insights into global warming. This data, from the ORAS5 system, combines models and global observations to offer a detailed view of ocean temperatures from 1958 to today.

## 
By January 2024, global sea surface temperatures set new records for the month, reflecting the ongoing warming trend [7]. As of late April 2024, Pacific temperatures began to show signs of cooling, indicating a potential transition to neutral conditions after the recent El Niño.

The latest World Meteorological Organization (WMO) forecasts indicate a 60% chance of transitioning from the current neutral conditions to La Niña conditions emerging towards the end of this year, bringing yet another shift in global weather patterns [8].

## Japan’s Marine Heatwave

Since 2023, sea surface temperatures in the North-West Pacific, especially off the east coast of Japan, have shown significant increases. Recent studies of atmospheric and ocean conditions revealed that this rise in sea temperatures, both at the surface and below, likely contributed to the record-breaking heatwave in northern Japan during the summer of 2023 [9]. In particular, the east coast of Japan experienced much warmer waters as the cool Oyashio current was replaced by warmer water, due to an unusual northward shift of the Kuroshio Extension that began in spring 2023.

#### Unusual Shift of the Kuroshio Extension
 Now, let's focus on the waters around Japan. In July 2023, sea surface temperatures (SST) were generally higher than normal, especially in the Pacific Ocean off the coasts of Tohoku and Hokkaido, where temperatures were more than 5°C above average. The map illustrates the Sea Surface Temperature from JAXA's GCOM-W around Japan on August 10, 2024. [**View more dates**](https://eodashboard.org/explore?indicator=ENSST&x=15431081.54924&y=4747312.96961&z=7.14583).
 
 The Kuroshio Extension, which usually flows eastward from Joban-oki, shifted northward to Sanriku-oki, bringing much warmer waters. According to a report from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), these high sea temperatures likely contributed to the record heat experienced in northern Japan this summer.

#### Monthly Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies
A closer look at monthly SST anomalies in the seas around Japan (20-50°N, 120-160°E) shows long-term temperature trends, excluding seasonal variations. SST anomalies in this region usually range between -1°C and +1°C, but August 2022 and July 2023 were notably warm.
Besides global warming, SSTs around Japan are affected by complex shifts in the ocean current system, which strongly influences the country’s weather, climate, and fisheries. To help monitor and forecast these changes, JAXA, in collaboration with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, operates the “Ocean Weather Forecast” for the area around Japan. This system provides forecasts for water temperatures and currents up to two weeks in advance, using SST data from the AMSR series to improve accuracy.

The figure below shows the monthly mean SST anomalies in the seas around Japan (20-50°N, 120-160°E), which shows the long-term trends of variations, excluding seasonal cycles.
