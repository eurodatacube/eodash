## Record-breaking temperatures: El Niño 2023-2024

2024 has seen an unprecedented streak of record-breaking global temperatures. The average global surface air temperature in April 2024 - the warmest April on record - [exceeded by 0.67°C](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-global-temperature-record-streak-continues-april-2024-was-hottest-record)  the 1991-2020 average and by 1.58°C the pre-industrial values. It was the eleventh consecutive month of [record-breaking temperatures](https://wmo.int/media/news/global-temperature-record-streak-continues-climate-change-makes-heatwaves-more-extreme ). Just the year before, 2023 was the warmest year back then on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2016, according to the [Copernicus State of the Climate report](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record). Over 200 days had new daily global temperatures records for the time of the year in 2023. Also sea surface temperatures were exceptionally high for much of the year, which are believed to contribute to the [lowest sea ice extension in the Antarctic Ocean](https://wmo.int/media/news/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record), both for the end-of-summer minimum in February and end-of-winter maximum in September.

The extreme temperatures experienced in 2023 and 2024 could be linked to El Niño, a climate pattern that warms the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, [influencing global weather](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/El_Nino ). This warming is associated with changes in atmospheric circulation which may result in extreme events [around the world](https://ncas.ac.uk/what-does-el-nino-mean-for-our-weather-climate-economy-and-health/ )  including heatwaves, floods and droughts. El Niño is part of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which refers to the entire cycle of these temperature fluctuations, and occurs irregularly every three to seven years. It starts when warm water from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward, replacing the cooler, nutrient-rich waters along the South American coast. This warmer water releases more moisture into the air, increasing rainfall and disturbing [global atmospheric circulation patterns](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/El_Nino ). ENSO affects [most intensely the tropics, including vulnerable countries](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/el-nino-southern-oscillation-%28enso%29 ) and areas in Africa, Latin America, and South and South-East Asia. El Niño’s counterpart, known as ‘La Niña’, is considered the ‘cool phase’ of ENSO, and describes the unusual cooling of the region’s surface waters.

Despite the La Niña conditions in early 2023, global temperatures continued to rise, raising concerns among scientists about the potential for even more extreme heat with the onset of the upcoming El Niño. The 2023 El Niño event officially started on July 4, 2023, as declared by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) after its development [was confirmed in June 2023](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3/Europe_braces_for_sweltering_July ). 

## Heatwaves worldwide
As intense heat waves gripped regions including the southern USA, Mediterranean, North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, including China, the World Meteorological Organization announced plans to monitor potential new temperature records. Data from the [Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s3-mission) revealed land surface temperatures exceeding 45°C in several Italian cities on 9-10 July, with some areas, such as the eastern slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, recording temperatures surpassing 50°C. Such summer heatwaves can have significant impacts on population health. A [study published in Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z ) highlighted the severe impact of 2022's summer heatwaves in Europe, resulting in over 60,000 deaths, with Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal having experienced the highest mortality rates. The 2023 European State of the Climate report indicates an increase in the number of “adverse health impacts” [caused by extreme weather and climate events](https://turkiye.un.org/en/266674-heat-related-deaths-increased-across-almost-all-europe-2023-says-un-weather-agency).

## Urban heat islands 
Living in a city during a heatwave can be particularly difficult as people have to deal with the urban heat island effect. Buildings, roads, pavements and other surfaces absorb and re-emit the Sun’s heat more than natural landcover such as forests and water bodies, causing urban areas to become ‘islands’ of higher temperatures compared to outlying rural areas. The difference between urban temperatures and rural temperatures tends to be more pronounced at night. Here, measurements of land-surface temperature are important to understand and monitor urban heat islands, and to plan mitigation strategies to reduce the effects of this phenomenon. It is worth noting the difference between air temperature and land-surface temperature. Air temperature, given in daily weather forecasts, is a measure of how hot the air is around 1 m above the ground. Land-surface temperature instead is a measure of how hot the actual surface would feel to the touch.

#### Night time temperatures measures by ECOSTRESS
During heatwaves the temperature of the surface tends to be hotter than the temperature of the air. Images of night-time surface temperatures, taken in July by an instrument called ECOSTRESS on the International Space Station show the land-surface temperature of Athens, Rome and Vienna in the evening or night-time on different dates in July 2023.
#### ECOSTRESS dataset
Measured on 15 July at 20:02 CEST, the surface temperature across the city of Athens is much the same – around 35°C. In comparison, the cooling effects of vegetation in Rome is clear to see. The ECOSTRESS instrument, owned by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is important because it is helping in the development of a new Copernicus Sentinel Expansion satellite – the Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM) mission – so images such as these offer a glimpse of what the new mission will [deliver operationally ]( https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Sensing_city_night_heat_from_space ).
