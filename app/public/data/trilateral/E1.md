## COVID19 impact on Commodities

Global commodity markets have been strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with sharp declines in prices since the early days of the pandemic. The decline affected all commodity prices, but differed by type (Figure). For example, prices for crude oil plummeted as a result of the drastically reduced demand during lock-down. As a consequence of the drastically reduced demands, tanker vessels carrying crude oil are reported to be anchored around the main oil refineries in Europe, unable to discharge their cargo due to a [lack of storage capacity in refineries and storage tanks](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-europe-tanker/tankers-pile-up-off-europes-coast-as-onshore-storage-sites-hit-limit-idUSL5N2C32X0). Natural rubber and platinum also experienced [large price declines](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33624/CMO-April-2020.pdf). The observed [decline in the prices for metal](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/04/23/coronavirus-shakes-commodity-markets) is understood to be linked to the declining economic growth in China. 

Earth observation can contribute to monitoring commodity markets in several ways. For example, by tracking shipping vessels, which are the primary transport vehicle for most commodities and which can be directly observed and categorised with Sentinel imagery and very high-resolution data. The changes in vessel dynamics within harbours with known landing piers for certain commodities can be used as a proxy for changes in the volume of ore stockpiled on site.
