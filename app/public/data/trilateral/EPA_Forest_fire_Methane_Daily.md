## Gridded 2012 EPA Methane Emissions - Forest Fires (daily)

## Dataset Description: 
Dataset represents a gridded inventory of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions from various sources. The inventory is designed to be consistent with the 2016 U.S. EPA [Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014) estimates for the year 2012, which presents national totals for different source types. The gridded inventory was developed using a wide range of databases at the state, county, local, and point source level to allocate the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions for individual source types.

This data can be used by researchers to better compare the national-level inventory with measurement results that may be at other scales.
