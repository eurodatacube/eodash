# Antarctica Melt Season End 2007 - 2021 
### VALUE ADDED PROTOTYPE PRODUCT

Author: Enveo IT, Fürstenweg 176, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria

Processing date: 2022-06-09 

This dataset illustrates the Melt Season End. The melt ending is marked by three consecutive days of stable winter (reference) conditions after the last refreezing event of the year. The product was generated based on melt maps (indicating presence of liquid water) from 2007 until 2021 derived from the ASCAT Enhanced Resolution Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) product [1]. The meltmaps (such as the one for 2021 depicted below) are also available on this Dashboard.

All products are provided in GeoTiff format at a grid spacing of 4.45 km x 4.45 km in the projection WGS 84 / NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic South (EPSG:3976). 

------------------------------------------------
[1] The SIR product is processed by the Microwave Earth Remote Sensing Laboratory (MERS) at Brigham Young University (BYU) and based on the full resolution (SZF) ASCAT C-Band Scatterometer data. It provides an enhanced resolution of 4.45 km by combining multiple pass, irregularly spaced data into higher-resolution gridded images. The SIR product used combines all data acquired within a single 24-hr period (msfa).

### Map baselayer and geometries

The Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier geometries shown on this map are for illustration purposes only. They were produced using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) by georeferencing maps made available by [the Polar Geospatial Center](https://data.pgc.umn.edu/maps/antarctica/pgc/19/preview/Thwaites%20Glacier%20Regional.jpg) and  the [Quantarctica/Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-close-is-the-west-antarctic-ice-sheet-to-a-tipping-point/).
