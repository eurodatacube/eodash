## Water quality in Ise Bay

**Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration** (Chl-a, mg/m3) can be derived from ocean colour satellite sensors.  

The **Chl-a anomaly** is the Chl-a difference from the reference climatological values and is expressed in %. It is used as an index to assess and monitor the potential effects of the lockdown, and subsequent recovery, on inland and coastal water quality. 

Chl-a is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance which fluctuates naturally with nutrient, solar irradiance, and water temperature, and so on. In coastal areas, Chl-a is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it is strongly influenced by river runoff and human activities, such as the discharge of urban sewage and agriculture fertilizers.


Another indicator, **Total Suspended Matter (TSM)** concentration, will be a help to understand the environmental changes, because the satellite Chl is sometimes influenced by other light-absorption components such as dissolved organic matter and the TSM shows more direct influence of the suspended-matter upwelling by the winds and the river outflow especially in the bay areas. 

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located.
