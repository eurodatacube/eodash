## Examples of COVID-19 impact on Air Quality - NO2

In an effort to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, government and public health officials have enacted various social distancing practices and other measures to limit human contact, at times placing entire countries on lockdown.
As human behavior has changed during the pandemic, ongoing measurements from Earth observing instruments have detected concurrent changes in environmental factors, such as a drop in the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2). 


Data shown here from the **[Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI jointly developed by The Netherlands and ESA)](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P/Tropomi)** on the **[European Space Agency’s (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite](https://www.copernicus.eu/en)** satellite and the **[Netherlands-Finnish instrument Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aura/spacecraft/omi.html)** on the **[Aura satellite](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aura/main/index.html)**, show significant drops in regional nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels that coincide with reduced traffic and industrial activity. 

The measurements presented here combine and average nitrogen dioxide data to account for variations in NO2 caused by weather, such as clouds and wind. This provides a clearer picture of the impact of human activity on NO2 levels. 
In Madrid, Milan, Rome, and Paris, for example, TROPOMI data show about a 50% reduction in NO2 from March 13-April 13, 2020 compared to the same months the year before. These reductions coincide with implementation of strict quarantine measures across Europe.

Similar reductions in air pollution have been observed in the Northeast United States. From Washington, D.C. to Boston, averaged OMI NO2 column data during lockdowns in March 2020 were 30% lower than averaged data for March 2015-2019.

TROPOMI observations over India also showed less air pollution during lockdowns in selected cities, such as New Delhi and Mumbai. Comparing the same timeframes in 2019, averaged NO2 concentrations from the first day of the lockdown on March 25-April 20, 2020 data show reductions of about 40-50% of air pollution. 
However, reductions in nitrogen dioxide were not consistent throughout India. Northeast India showed nearly constant values of NO2 levels due to ongoing operations at coal-based power plants, which did not reduce electric power generation significantly during the lockdown.

Similarly, as stay-at-home and other lockdown restrictions begin to ease, OMI and TROPOMI are observing rebounds in nitrogen dioxide levels.

This site will be updated with OMI and TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide data throughout the novel coronavirus pandemic.
