## Impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality

The **Water Quality index** was designed to assess the effect of the lockdown and the subsequent recovery on inland and coastal waters by monitoring the deviation from a climatological mean of chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration as measured from optical sensors onboard the three agency’s satellites, namely **[Sentinel-3 (ESA)](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3)**, **[GCOM-C (JAXA)](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)** and **[Aqua (NASA)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**.

Chlorophyll-a concentration is an indicator of algae abundance which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).  


### Water Quality Time Series

The displayed time series show weekly **Chl concentration anomalies (%)** as calculated from **[Sentinel-3](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-3)** (<span style="color:#a37">purple</span>), **[MODIS](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/aqua/)**  (<span style="color:#47a">blue</span>) and **[GCOM-C](https://global.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gcom_c/)**(<span style="color:#03A9F4">light blue</span>) around the **Alta Aqua Oceanographic Tower** (AAOT at 45.30 N, 12.50 E) in the North Adriatic Sea, the **Mediterranean sub-basin** most influenced by river runoff, in particular by the **Po River**, which is the largest river in Italy and which runs along many different industrialized areas. 

Despite existing differences in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of the three optical sensors, as well as in the algorithms used to calculate the Chl concentration, all three sensors highlight a predominance of negative anomalies of Chl concentration during the entire lockdown period, which indicate a water with lower amounts of Chl, compared to what is usually observed at this time of the year.

These anomalously low values were found to result from the cumulated impact of a number of natural phenomena. In particular, low wind magnitudes (top plot of Fig.1) were recorded at the AAOT from 5th to 20th April, which, by preserving the vertical stratification of the water column, hindered upwelling of nutrient-rich waters that may enhance the growth of phytoplankton. Such hypothesis is confirmed by significant increase of SST (bottom plot of Fig. 1), as measured by a multi-sensor product (including data from NOAA-18, MetOpA-B, Aqua, Terra, MSG1, NPP, Meteosat11, Sentinel 3A-B) at the AAOT  during that period.

On top of this particular local conditions, water level data of Po River at Pontelagoscuro station (~50 km upstream the river mouth) show that the lowest values of Chl concentration anomalies occur during the minimum of the Po River water discharge, recorded mid April 2020 (bottom panel of Fig. 2), which indicates a reduced input of cold waters from the Po River tributaries debouching in the North Adriatic basin. The particularly warm bulge and the associated SST pattern along the north-west coast of the basin mark a reduction of the well-known cold coastal current that constitute the natural conveyor belt of the North Adriatic river plumes, i.e., the primary source of nutrient and sediment loads that flow southward.  

Finally, we cannot exclude **a mutual role of a decrease of human activities that enhanced the negative anomaly in Chl concentration** as highlighted by the low turbidity values in the Po river measured by Sentinel-2 in the lockdown phase (top panel of Fig. 2)

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located.
