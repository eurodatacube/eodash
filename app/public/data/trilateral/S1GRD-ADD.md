# Sentinel-1 observations of Antarctica

Provider: SentinelHub ([Euro Data Cube](https://eurodatacube.com/documentation/analysis-ready-data))

The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is designed as a two-satellite constellation. Each satellite carries an advanced radar instrument to provide an all-weather, day-and-night supply of imagery of Earth’s surface.  

Sentinel-1’s radar can operate in four modes: Interferometric Wide Swath (IW), Extra Wide Swath (EW), Wave (WV) and Stripmap (SM).

The dataset shown here is acquired in the EW Mode.

## Extra Wide Swath

The Extra Wide (EW) swath mode employs the TOPSAR technique to acquire data over a wide area: a 400 km swath at 20 m by 40 m spatial resolution.

The EW mode is aimed primarily for use over sea-ice, polar zones and certain maritime areas, in particular for ice, oil spill monitoring and security services. Like IW, EW mode can also be used for interferometry since it shares the same characteristics for burst synchronisation, baseline and Doppler stability.

### Map baselayer and geometries

The Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier geometries shown on this map are for illustration purposes only. They were produced using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) by georeferencing maps made available by [the Polar Geospatial Center](https://data.pgc.umn.edu/maps/antarctica/pgc/19/preview/Thwaites%20Glacier%20Regional.jpg) and  the [Quantarctica/Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-close-is-the-west-antarctic-ice-sheet-to-a-tipping-point/).

This map uses the baselayer Antarctic hillshade and bathymetry south of 60°S. Citation: REMA: Howat, I. M., Porter, C., Smith, B.
