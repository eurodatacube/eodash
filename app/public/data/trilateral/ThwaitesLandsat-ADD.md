### Surface reflectance

Surface reflectance (unitless) measures the fraction of incoming solar radiation that is reflected from the Earth's surface to the Landsat sensor. The LEDAPS and LaSRC surface reflectance algorithms correct for the temporally, spatially and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases, aerosols, and water vapor, which is necessary to reliably characterize the Earth’s land surface.

### Data Access

This dataset consists of pre-selected cloud-free Landsat 7,8,9 surface reflectance scenes from 2000-2023 taken over the area of both glaciers.

Data access is provided by the [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/), via the on-the-fly XYZ tile service powered by [TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/) referencing Cloud Optimized COGs.

### Map baselayer and geometries

The Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier geometries shown on this map are for illustration purposes only. They were produced using [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) by georeferencing maps made available by [the Polar Geospatial Center](https://data.pgc.umn.edu/maps/antarctica/pgc/19/preview/Thwaites%20Glacier%20Regional.jpg) and  the [Quantarctica/Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-close-is-the-west-antarctic-ice-sheet-to-a-tipping-point/).
