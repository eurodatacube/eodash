International collaboration among space agencies is central to the success of satellite Earth observations and data analysis, aiming at providing an accurate and timely information to decision-makers, main stakeholders and public. These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.

The **European Space Agency (ESA)**, **Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)**, and **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard, which strengthens our global understanding of the changing environment with human activity.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use resource for all kinds of public from the scientist to the decision-maker, including people not familiar with satellites. Based on accurate remote sensing observations, it shows how or example, how social distancing measures and regional shelter-in-place guidelines affected Earth’s air, land, and water during the pandemic. The dashboard offers a precise, objective and factual view without any artifacts of our planet. You can explore countries and regions around the world to see how the indicators in specific locations changed over time.

ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to enhance this dashboard as new data becomes available.

## Documentation

EO Dashboard is supported by the three agencies via several activities. Each agency contributes with:
- EO Data and EO Science 
- In-kind expertise (science, technology, and communication experts)
- Infrastructure and technology: [NASA’s VEDA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/), ESA’s [Euro Data Cube](https://eurodatacube.com) and the [Network of Resources](https://nor-discover.org), [Jaxa’s Earth-graphy](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/)

More information is available on the EO Dashboard Github page:

### Hands-on Tutorials and Competitions 

If you are participating in a competition or tutorial using the EO Dashboard, you will be working in a JupyterLab Workspace in the EDC environment. Access to the EDC services will be provided free of charge by ESA.  

Free trial subscrptions to EDC can be used at any time to familiarize with the platform, but specific tutorial notebooks and other material will only be availale in the free environment provided for the tutorial or competition.

To use the EDC services participants need to register for an EDC account using a specific EVENT URL announced prior to the event. 
Upon registration, a tailored workspace is made available either immediatelly or at the start of the event.
A notification via email is sent to participants once the workspace is available at https://hub.eox.at.

## Example Jupyter Notebooks

Free Jupyter Notebooks with the tag "EO Dashboard" are accessible from the EDC marketplace.

They contain examples for how to access the different Earth observation data and indicators and create similar visualisations as the ones displayed on EO Dashboard.

On the marketplace you can also discover general purpose Notebooks on the EDC services, as well as many examples of applications developed on top of these services.

## Data 

The data powering the EO Dashboard is provided via:
- Euro Data Cube services (Sentinel Hub, geodb)
- NASA STAC API
- JAXA web services
- other open sources and services.

The Jupyter Notebook called **"Data Access"** contains the list of available datasets + scripts to use the services and get the data.
