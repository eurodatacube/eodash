# Earth Observing Dashboard

### by NASA, ESA, JAXA


International collaboration among space agencies is central to the success of satellite Earth observations and data analysis, aiming at providing an accurate and timely information to decision-makers, main stakeholders and public. These partnerships foster more comprehensive measurements, robust datasets, and cost-effective missions.

The **European Space Agency (ESA)**, **Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)**, and **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard, which strengthens our global understanding of the changing environment with human activity.

The dashboard provides an easy-to-use resource for all kinds of public from the scientist to the decision-maker, including people not familiar with satellites. Based on accurate remote sensing observations, it helps to illustrate changes affecting Earth’s air, land, or water, and offers a precise, objective and factual view without any artifacts of our planet. You can explore countries and regions around the world to see how the indicators in specific locations changed over time. 

Supported by the rich information provided by the EO data, the dashboard provides interactive narratives addressing societally relevant topics, such as the importance of forests in the climate system, accelerating melting in the Arctic, or processes ocurring in the oceans. 

ESA, JAXA, and NASA will continue to enhance this dashboard as new data becomes available.

## Documentation

EO Dashboard is supported by the three agencies via several activities. Each agency contributes with EO Data, scientific expertise, and technology, including: [NASA’s VEDA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/), ESA’s [Euro Data Cube](https://eurodatacube.com) and the [Network of Resources](https://nor-discover.org), and [Jaxa’s Earth-graphy](https://earth.jaxa.jp/en/). 

More information is available on the EO Dashboard Github page:

The EO Dashboard application is based on the [eodash ecosystem](https://eodash.org/). 

## Hands-on Tutorials and Competitions 

The EO Dashboard is organising and supporting hands-on workshops and global open competitions, including the NASA Space Apps, the EO Dashboard Hackathon and IGARSS Tutorials, workshops at FOSS4G, and many others.
