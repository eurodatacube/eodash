[ESA](https://www.esa.int), [JAXA](https://global.jaxa.jp/) and [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) have combined their resources, technical knowledge, and expertise to produce this Earth Observing Dashboard to strengthen our global understanding of the changing environment with human activies. 

### EXPLORE DATASETS

Here you can browse the Earth Observation datasets and use the interactive features, including maps that compute simple analytics by drawing an area of interest. Other datasets are tabular data, presented as charts. All charts can be downloaded as CSV. 

The open data and project source code can be accessed in [Github](https://github.com/eurodatacube/eodash)
