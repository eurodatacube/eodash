## RACE Dashboard Challenges 2021

How can EO contribute to monitoring and understanding the impacts of the pandemic on the economy and the environment?

Replying to this question has been the objective of the Rapid Action on COVID19 with Earth Observation (RACE) initiative since its launch, in spring 2020, by ESA and the European Commission (EC).

The investigation is ongoing new challenges are regularly released, open to anyone with innovative ideas to exploit the wealth of data available to discover some novel analytic approaches that allow improved understanding of pandemic-related processes in different aspects of society, economy and the environment.
Here follows a list of challenges to date, with info on winners and the indicators they derived, already embedded or about to be embedded in the dashboard.

### <span style="color:green">[OPEN UNTIL 30 November 2021: Challenge #3 – Multithematic](https://eo4society.esa.int/2021/08/01/rapid-action-on-coronavirus-and-eo-race-dashboard-challenge-3/)</span>

**Objectives**

Design and develop an indicator of the pandemic’s impacts on society on any of the transport and pollution, socio-economic impact, recovery themes or propose a completely new theme.

### [Challenge #2 - How to combine socio-economic indicators into one impact metric across European regions?](https://eo4society.esa.int/2021/04/01/rapid-action-on-coronavirus-and-eo-race-dashboard-challenge-2/)

**Objectives**

Develop an integrated socio-economic indicator (based on several sub-indicators/proxies) to characterise the pandemic’s impact on socio-economic activity in a region/country at a point in time by use of EO-based and interdisciplinary data available in the RACE dashboard and the Euro Data Cube.

### [Challenge #1 - How does the pandemic affect shipping traffic and related air and water quality?](https://eo4society.esa.int/2021/03/02/rapid-action-on-coronavirus-and-eo-race-challenge-1/)

**Objectives**

Develop innovative, integrated ways to characterise shipping vessel dynamics, atmospheric parameters and ocean water quality by use of EO-based and interdisciplinary data available in the RACE dashboard and the Euro Data Cube.

**Status**: <span style="color:red">Closed</span>

**What was the winning idea** 

This challenge's winner is [Alessandro Cimbelli](https://eo4society.esa.int/2021/07/08/race-challenges-2021-first-winner/), who developed a S1-based indicator to count anchored large vessels (i.e. cargo/tankers) in major harbours and cross-correlated their number with air quality (i.e. S5P-derived CO emissions).

The indicator is now being upscaled to a larger AOI, in order to have it integrated in the dashboard.

## Dashboard Challenges 2020

### [Multi-thematic Challenge](https://eo4society.esa.int/2020/04/06/euro-data-cube-custom-script-contest-covid-19-edition/)

**Objectives**

Analysis of changes in:
  -	economic operators’ activity (e.g. factories, supermarkets, transport networks, oil refineries, commercial ports),
  -	human activity distribution (e.g. parked car distributions over urban areas, social distancing estimations),
  -	agriculture activity (e.g. unattended fields and crops, disruptions due to supply chain issues, things that may contribute to mitigation of problems appearing in 6 months from now).

**Status** : <span style="color:red">Closed</span>

**What were the winning ideas**
