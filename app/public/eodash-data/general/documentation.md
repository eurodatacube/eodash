# Documentation

The EO Dashboard relies mainly on the [Euro Data Cube (EDC)](https://eurodatacube.com/) services and infrastructure. 
If you are participating in a competition or tutorial using the EO Dashboard, you will require working with these services. 

## Euro Data Cube (EDC)

To use the EDC resources, such as the JupyterLab Workspace, participants to competitions/tutorials need to register for an EDC account using the specific EVENT URL. 
Upon registration, a tailored workspace is made available (usually available within 2 working days). 
A notification via email is sent to participants once the workspace is available.

*Please note: you should NOT create an account from the main page of the EDC site because it will not be
tailored to your competition/tutorial. Only use the provided EVENT URL.* 

Once you are registered and have been notified that your EDC resources are ready you may access your EDC JupyterLab Workspace from the EDC Dashboard.

In the EDC JupyterLab Workspace you may access the various EDC resources like tutorial notebooks from the Launcher page.

## Example Jupyter Notebooks

Free Jupyter Notebooks with the tag "EO Dashboard" are accessible from the EDC marketplace.

They contain examples for how to access the different Earth observation data and indicators and create similar visualisations as the ones displayed on EO Dashboard.

On the marketplace ypu can also discover general purpose Notebooks on the EDC services, as well as many examples of applications developed on top of these services.

## Data 

The data powering the EO Dashboard is provided via:
- Euro Data Cube services (Sentinel-hub, Geodb)
- NASA STAC API
- JAXA web services
- other open sources and services.

The Jupyter Notebook called **"Data Access"** contains the list of available datasets + scripts to use the services and get the data.
