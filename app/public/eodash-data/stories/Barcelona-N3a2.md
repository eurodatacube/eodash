## Water Quality in Ebro River mouth (Tarragoa and Coastal areas)

Chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration is an indicator of microalgae abundance, which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, river inputs and sediment resuspension enhance phytoplankton grow. Human activities modify the natural state as a result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters (i.e., eutrophication), triggering undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration and a loss of biodiversity.

Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is the mass concentration of organic and inorganic materials suspended in the water column. TSM concentration is higher near the coasts due to the resuspension of terrestrial or submarine particulate matter by tides, waves, and currents. TSM is another proxy for water quality as different contaminants that originate inland, including fertilizers, trace metals, semi-volatile organic compounds, and numerous pesticides, can aggregate to these solids and be brought in suspension. This can alter the state of the aquatic ecosystem and the use of freshwater resources. For instance, excessive suspended material might condition primary productivity and hamper the underwater visibility for fish. 

## The impacts of COVID-19 on Water Quality 

The effect of the lockdown and the subsequent recovery on inland and coastal waters were assessed by monitoring the deviation from a weekly climatological mean of chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) as measured by OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3. The displayed maps show weekly Chl concentration anomalies (%) and weekly Total Suspended Matter concentration anomalies (%) in the North-Eastern part of the Spanish coastal area, in the Mediterranean Sea. The area includes the Ebro River delta as well as the Tarragona and Barcelona coastal areas, which are both largely affected by anthropic effects due to industrial and touristic activities. Besides the Ebro, the Llobregat River is also of high regional importance. It disembogues few kilometers south of Barcelona and is under a high stress due to intense urban, agricultural and industrial use.

The maps show a rather patchy distribution (in space and time) of both Chl concentration and Total Suspended Matter weekly anomaly. However, two general alternating patterns can be observed:

i)	null, weak, or negative anomalies over the whole area, likely due to weak upwelling or favorable coastal currents, often superimposed to small-scale positive anomalies that originate from river runoffs and local anthropic areas that release biogeochemical inputs (i.e., Ebro River, Tarragona, and Barcelona coastal areas). 

ii)	large-scale positive anomalies over the whole coastal sector, likely due to strong upwelling phenomena that occur at sub-basin scale, often characterized by small-scale negative anomalies off the Ebro River mouth, as well as off the Tarragona and Barcelona coastal areas. This intriguing pattern is particularly evident during April and May 2020 (i.e., during the Spanish lockdown). 

In general, we note that the coherency of pattern (i) off the three anthropic areas we focused on is often observed (about two times per month) before the lockdown while pattern (ii), in the winter 2020 season, is scarcely recognizable. During the lockdown, on the other hand, pattern (ii) results to be more frequent (twice a month) than pattern (i), which occurs only two times from March to June. Further analysis is needed to understand these local chlorophyll-a and total suspended mater concentration anomalies that occur during the lockdown are linked to a decrease of anthropogenic activities and/or to the natural variability of meteo-oceanographic conditions.
