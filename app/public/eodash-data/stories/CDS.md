## Meteorological variables: Temperature, Humidity and Wind

This data is made available by the [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/)


We present 4 variables:

- **Temperature:** This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (Â°C) by subtracting 273.15.

- **Relative Humidity:** 	The temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity.

- **Wind (u component):** 	This parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

- **Wind (v component):** This parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

## Understanding COVID-19 outbreak sensitivity to weather conditions
Several studies early in the COVID-19 outbreak tried to understand if the spread of the disease had sensitivity to weather conditions. Scientists looked at the influence of various factors including temperature, dew point, relative humidity, water vapor, or wind and found positive [correlation with the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a number of regions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85493-y). 

Futher research is needed to draw consistent conclusions and to reveal associations between the spread of the disease and weather seasonality. 
The meteorological data presented here are monthly averages from C3S ERA5 reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics.
