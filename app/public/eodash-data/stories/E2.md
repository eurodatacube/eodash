## Global commodity markets

Earth Observation can contribute in serval ways for monitoring of commodity markets. For example, shipping by tracking shipping vessels, which are the primary transport vehicle for most commodities and which can be directly observed and categorised with Sentinel imagery and very high resolution data. The changes in vessel dynamics within harbours with known landing piers for certain commodities can be  used as a proxy for changes in the volume of ore stockpiled on site.

## The impacts of COVID-19 on Commodities

Global commodity markets have been strongly affected by the COVID19 pandemic, with sharp declines in prices since the early first of the pandemic. The decline affected all commodity prices, but differed by type (Figure). For example, prices for crude oil plummeted as a result of the drastically reduced demand during lock-down. As a consequence of the drastically reduced demands, tanker vessels carrying crude oil have been reported to be anchored around the main oil refineries in Europe, unable to discharge their cargo due to a [lack of storage capacity in refineries and storage tanks](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-europe-tanker/tankers-pile-up-off-europes-coast-as-onshore-storage-sites-hit-limit-idUSL5N2C32X0). Natural rubber and platinum also experienced [large price declines](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33624/CMO-April-2020.pdf). The observed [decline in the prices for metal](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/04/23/coronavirus-shakes-commodity-markets) is understood to be linked to the declining economic growth in China. 

### Analysing the effect of lockdown measures on comodities:
For each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford Universityâ€™s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).
