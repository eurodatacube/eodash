## Status of Production activity for intermediate goods

This indicator assesses the intermediate goods production sites (steel mills/other metal production, cement production, chemicals/plastics production).

### Parking Lot occupancy as proxy for Activity Level

This indicator is based on the assessment of relevant areas at production sites, such as employee car park (full/empty), exhaust plumes (steam etc), thermal signature (furnace heat, cooling water etc). The status of the area is assessed based n very high resolution optical imagery and is compared to a baseline (for example the situation in the same month one year before).

#### Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on production activity for intermediate goods
For each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford Universityâ€™s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).
