## COVID-19 Lockdown effects on output inventory level at finished goods production sites

At the logistic areas operated at the production sites such as motor vehicle manufacturing, the large number of metal objects (e.g. machinery, vehicles) produces a strong signature in the radar backscatter signal. The observations provided by the Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites such as the C-band [Copernicus Sentinel-1](http://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1) or the X-band Iceye satellites permit comparative measurements between 2019 and 2020 of the average backscatter signal at the output logistic areas.

### The impacts of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions at finished goods production sites

To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, EU Member States have taken a number of restrictive measures. According to [EUROSTAT](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20200612-2), these imposed measures had in general a negative effect on demand and thus on industrial production in many areas. In March 2020, industrial production in the EU fell by 10.9% compared with February 2020 and by 12.2% compared with March 2019. The fall continued in April 2020, when EU industrial production fell by 17.3% compared with March 2020 and by 27.2% compared with April 2019.

Across the different industries, the largest decline in production in March and April 2020 was registered by **motor vehicles** (-33.5 % in March and -68.5 in April compared with the previous months), followed by manufacturing of leather products (-40.4% and -60.2%) and wearing apparel (-32.8% and -30.4%).

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) currently forecasts a drop in passenger car registrations in the European Union, falling from 12.8 million last year to just 9.6 million units in 2020.*

#### Industrial production in the Member States

Eurostat reports that in March compared with February 2020 the largest decreases were recorded in Italy (-28.4%), Slovakia (-20.3%) and Luxembourg (-19.8%). In March, industrial production still increased in four Member States, in Ireland (15.3%), Finland (2.2%), Greece (1.9%) and Lithuania (1.7%). In April compared with March 2020 the industrial production fell in all Member States, with the largest decreases in Hungary (-30.5%), Romania (-27.7%) and Slovakia (-26.7%). The industries with the highest declines in production in March and April (manufacturing of motor vehicles, leather products, wearing apparel, textiles and furniture) also saw exceptionally high growth rates, due to the extremely low levels that the production of these products had reached in April 2020 (base effect).
