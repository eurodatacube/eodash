Teruel airport is the largest airplane storage site for Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) in Europe. The dry climate in the region and Teruel's large capacity of storage makes this airport a particularly suitable place for long term storage.

The Teruel airport runwaya faced a dramatic increase of demand during the COVID-19. Travel restrictions due to the pandemic were responsible for two thirds of the worldâ€™s passenger airplanes on the ground in May 2020. To face this situation, airlines have had to find a solution to store their aircrafts. Some have chosen to park them on closed runways like Frankfurt, others have chosen to send their aircrafts to some storage sites.
