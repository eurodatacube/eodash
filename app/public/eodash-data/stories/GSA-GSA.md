## Freigh circulation at 'Green Lanes'
The European Commission has requested Member States to designate **Trans-European transport NeTwork (TEN-T)** border-crossing points as ‘Green Lane’ border crossings to guarantee essential products priority access. The Commission expects that going through these ‘Green Lane’ border crossings, including any checks, should not exceed 15 minutes on internal land borders.

This a network of roads, railways, airports and water infrastructure in the European Union counts with around 180 border crossing points.

The interactive charts enable exploration of individual border crossing points, and to compare the daily waiting times on both travel directions starting from June 2020 to March 2021. Input data is verified with the data taken from trucks at the border. 

## The impacts of COVID-19 on freight circulation 

Several EU Member States have either closed borders with other members or imposed new health screening controls to further prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, freight circulation needs to continue to ensure European citizens will have access to food, medical equipment, medicines and other essential goods.
