# Wildlife Indicator

V3 - 2024/04/17

- **Spatial coverage:** Europe
- **Temporal coverage:** 10 years (2013 â€“ 2022)
- **Spatial resolution:** 10km
- **Format:** COG product


Includes the following layers


- **vegetation** : Vegetation health indicator, with 1 being the areas in the worst health and
5 the areas in the best health in 2023 compared to long term trends
- **road_pressure** : Road pressure on connectivity areas, fragmentation of natural
habitats due to roads by calculating and comparing connectivity areas bordered only
by coastlines and those interrupted by roads. The results quantify the pressure
exerted by road networks on natural spaces, helping to identify areas under high road
pressure. Where 1 is an area with very high road pressure, the difference between the
connectivity of the area with and without roads is great, and 5 is an area with very little
road pressure.
- **species_count_quintile** : Categorized species density into five equal groups based
on the adjusted and normalized 'species_count_bounds', offering a stratified
understanding of biodiversity distribution.
- **wildlife** : Biodiversity indicator, aggregation of data on the number of species present
in the area, vegetation quality and spatial connectivity.
