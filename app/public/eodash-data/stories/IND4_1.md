Includes the following layers:

- Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) : shared socioeconomic pathways are climate scenarios of projected global changes up to 2150. They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios with different climate policies. The scenarios are presented starting from the more optimistic one (e.g. SSP119) till the most pessimistic one ( e.g. SSP585) (more details IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf )

- Storm surge height in m: Storm surge is the unusual rise in seawater level during a storm, measured as the height of the water above the normal predicted astronomical tide.

The Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios are described below:

- SSP119:  holds warming to approximately 1.5°C above 1850-1900 in 2100 after slight overshoot (median) and implies net zero CO2 emissions around the middle of the century.
- SSP126:  stays below 2.0°C warming relative to 1850-1900 (median) with implied net zero emissions in the second half of the century.
- SSP245:  is approximately in line with the upper end of aggregate Nationally Determined Contribution emission levels by 2030. SR1.5 assessed temperature projections for NDCs to be between 2.7 and 3.4°C by 2100, corresponding to the upper half of projected warming under 
- SSP245: New or updated NDCs by the end of 2020 did not significantly change the emissions projections up to 2030, although more countries adopted 2050 net zero targets in line with SSP119 or SSP126. The SSP245 scenario deviates mildly from a ‘no-additional- climate-policy’ reference scenario, resulting in a best-estimate warming around 2.7°C by the end of the 21st century relative to 1850-1900.
- SSP370: is a medium to high reference scenario resulting from no additional climate policy under the SSP3 socioeconomic development narrative. SSP370 has particularly high non-CO2 emissions, including high aerosols emissions.
- SSP585: is a high reference scenario with no additional climate policy. Emission levels as high as SSP585 are not obtained by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) under any of the SSPs other than the fossil fueled SSP5 socioeconomic development pathway.
