## Port Activities, sources of pollution and NO2 levels 

This indicator looks jointly at different sources of pollution and the NO2 level computed from Sentinel-5P satellite, analysing the trend between 2019 and 2020.
These variables, all together, give high level information of how those different element impact NO2 level and represent a starting point for this kind of integrated analysis.

Thus, the graphs reports an analysis of:

- **The correlation between NO2 levels and boat traffic:** [AIS data of all the boats coming to the ports](https://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Pages/AIS.aspx) have been collected and compared with the normalized value of NO2 over the port computed from daily data. It is visible that these two variable are highly correlated; this may be an indication of how much bog boats traffic impacts the pollution of ports areas.

- **The correlation between NO2 levels and car traffic:** [TomTom data about the mean daily number of car in the main access street to the port](https://www.tomtom.com/products/traffic-and-travel-information/) have been collected and compared with the normalized value of NO2 over the port computed from daily data. The two variables are not as correlated as the pervious variables. This underlines that the car traffic it gives a smaller impact to the port pollution level with respect to other quantities.

- **The correlation between NO2 level and people presence in the port:**  this analysis has been conducted using anonymised mobile data from 2020 provided by Vodafone (2019 data are not available). Vodafone data contain information about the total number of people present in the port area.

## Analising the impacts of COVID-19 lockdonw restrictions on pollution and NO2 levels: 
The pandemic restrictions and the related economic crisis have highly impacted the pollution level in different areas of Europe and of the world. Although this fact has been widely demonstrated, this specific analysis aims looks jointly at different sources of pollution and the NO2 level. 

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).
