## COVID19 Impact on Air Quality

The air quality analysis focuses on assessing the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the subsequent economic recovery by monitoring tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) measured by the TROPOMI instrument on-board [Copernicus Sentinel-5P](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P).

The coronavirus (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly across the world and has been declared a global pandemic by the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/). In order to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, countries across the world have been implementing various social distancing measures restricting people’s movements by placing cities and even entire countries on lockdown. 

Earth observing satellites like the **TROPOMI** instrument on the [Copernicus Sentinel-5P](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P) are being used to map air pollution worldwide and have revealed a **significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations** – coinciding with the strict quarantine measures which cause less emissions of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide due to reduced traffic and industrial activities.

### Nitrogen dioxide concentrations

The nitrogen dioxide concentrations vary from day to day due to changes in the weather (such as wind speed, cloudiness, etc) and **conclusions cannot be drawn based on just one day of data alone**. By combining data for a specific period of time (e.g. averaging over 14 days) the meteorological variability partially averages out and impact of changes due to human activity become more clearly visible.

Averaged TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 13 March until 13 April 2020, compared to the March-April averaged concentrations from 2019 show reduced Nitrogen Dioxide concentrations in the European cities Madrid, Milan, Rome and Paris in the range of about 50% – coinciding with the strict quarantine measures implemented across Europe.
