## Venice - Water Quality Time Series


The water quality analysis focuses on assessing the effect of the lockdown and the subsequent economic recovery on inland and coastal water quality by monitoring the deviation from a climatological mean of Chlorophyll-a concentration over a number of key Areas of Interest.

The time series shows weekly Chl-a concentration offshore the Venice lagoon (45.30 N, 12.50 E) as calculated from [Sentinel-3](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci) full resolution (250m) data:

* **<span style="color:green">Green dots</span>** show weekly values lower than the climatological mean (in black), indicating good water quality.
* **<span style="color:blue">Blue dots</span>** show weekly values greater than the climatological mean but still inside the climatological variability, indicating regular water quality.
* **<span style="color:red">Red dots</span>** stand for values beyond the climatological variability, indicating poorer water quality.

On the indicator chart, for each day, the light/dark red chart background indicates whether there were **restrictions or lockdown** measure in place in the country where the city is located. This information is based on [Oxford University’s coronavirus government response tracker](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/). 


### Example of the impact of COVID-19 on Water Quality

In accordance with the weekly mean anomaly maps of Chl concentration, the time series shows after the lockdown date (March, 11th) predominant presence of days recording good water quality (green dots) and, in particular, a total absence of red dots. After the post-lockdown date (May, 4th) regular and low water quality (i.e., presence of blue and red dots) are recorded. This observation actually matches with the reactivation of some socio-economic activities within the investigated area.

These anomalously low values indicate a water with lower amounts of Chl, compared to what is usually observed at this time of the year. A more in-depth analysis showed that they result from the cumulated impact of a number of natural phenomena. In particular, low wind magnitudes (top plot of Figure 1) were recorded at the AAOT from 5th to 20th April, which, by preserving the vertical stratification of the water column, hindered upwelling of nutrient-rich waters that may enhance the growth of phytoplankton. Such hypothesis is confirmed by significant increase of SST (bottom plot of Figure 1), as measured by a multi-sensor product (including data from NOAA-18, MetOpA-B, Aqua, Terra, MSG1, NPP, Meteosat11, Sentinel 3A-B) at the AAOT  during that period.

On top of this particular local conditions, water level data of Po River at Pontelagoscuro station (\~50 km upstream the river mouth) show that the lowest values of Chl concentration anomalies occur during the minimum of the Po River water discharge, recorded mid April 2020 (bottom panel of Figure 2), which indicates a reduced input of cold waters from the Po River tributaries debouching in the North Adriatic basin. The particularly warm bulge and the associated SST pattern along the north-west coast of the basin mark a reduction of the well-known cold coastal current that constitute the natural conveyor belt of the North Adriatic river plumes, i.e., the primary source of nutrient and sediment loads that flow southward.

Finally, we cannot exclude **a mutual role of a decrease of human activities that enhanced the negative anomaly in Chl concentration** as highlighted by the low turbidity values in the Po river measured by Sentinel-2 in the lockdown phase (top panel of Figure 2)
