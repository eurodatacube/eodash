## Oil tanks - Rotterdam, Netherlands

Rotterdam harbour is the european leader in oil storage, and the tanks' filling level can be observed on ICEYE imagery.
The status of crude oil reserves is of great importance to the oil market and an essential factor in global economic development. That means frequent and accurate updates on reserve levels are crucial. ICEYE’s new SAR satellite capability now offers daily refreshed information on the storage level of oil tanks - a novelty for the industry which uses synthetic-aperture radar (SAR)to conduct daily analysis of oil production and consumption. 

As remote sensing sensors cannot “see” through walls and roofs, the volume of oil in storage tanks can only be measured if it is an above-ground tank with an external floating roof. This type of tank is designed to store large quantities of crude oil. The roof floats on the surface of the oil, rising and falling with the volume of the oil in the tanks to reduce the vapor space above the oil level. The height of the roof is linked to the filling volumes in the tanks.

By measuring the height and perimeter of the floating tanks as well as certain other tank dimensions, the storage volume can be reliably calculated.

#### The impacts of COVID-19 on oil tanks storages

Oil sector faced a sudden decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As oil prices dropped below zero for the first time in April 2020, storage tanks had never been so full.  In July, tanks were still very full. During the COVID-19 pandemic, oil storage filled up as demand for oil decreased due to reduced travels.
