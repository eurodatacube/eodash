The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) Evolution product illustrates the worldwide growth of human settlements on a year-by-year basis from 1985 to 2015. Each color shows settlements added on that year.
In particular, the layer has been derived by processing about 7-million Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 scenes and it features 30m spatial resolution.

The WSF 2019 product shown underneath the Evolution layer presents the global state of settlements in year 2019 in higher resolution. The layer has been derived by means of 2019 multitemporal Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery.
