## About the Air 2m Twmoerature (C3S) Indicator
This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (Â°C) by subtracting 273.15.

## How it is generated

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades.
The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution [1,2]
