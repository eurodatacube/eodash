## Observing growth of human settlements

Urban sprawl (i.e. dispersed expansion of settlements at low densities) impacts the environment, economy and society. According to research [1], between 1990 and 2014 humans converted more land to settlements than in all previous millennia combined and urban sprawl almost doubled globally, increasing by close to 4% per year.

## The World Settlement Footprint Dataset

The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) Evolution product illustrates the worldwide growth of human settlements on a year-by-year basis from 1985 to 2015.
In particular, the layer has been derived by processing about 7-million Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 scenes and it features 30m spatial resolution.
