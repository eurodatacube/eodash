## About the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration Indicator
Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an indicator of algae abundance which fluctuates naturally over space and time, as a result of combined atmospheric and oceanic effects (e.g., marine currents and upwelling). In coastal areas, strongly influenced by river inputs and human activities, high Chl concentration can result from the discharge of urban sewage, industrial runoffs, and fertilizers from agriculture activities over watersheds. In particular, nutrient inputs of anthropogenic origin affect the natural amount of phytoplankton in marine and inland waters, representing a continuous threat to biodiversity and leading to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication).

## How was is it generated
A study [1] developed by [CNR-ISMAR](http://www.ismar.cnr.it/) utilized a combination of Sentinel-2 [2] and Sentinel-3 [3] data, and an algorithm was developed to estimate chlorophyll concentrations based on the reflectance values from different spectral bands. The algorithm was calibrated and validated using in-situ measurements of chlorophyll concentrations from water samples. Once calibrated, the algorithm was applied to the entire study area to generate spatially continuous maps of chlorophyll concentrations. This satellite-based approach allowed for broad coverage and frequent monitoring of chlorophyll concentrations over time, providing a comprehensive assessment of chlorophyll dynamics in the water bodies under investigation. The estimated chlorophyll concentrations from the satellite data were further compared with other remotely sensed data and environmental variables to identify and understand the factors influencing chlorophyll levels, such as water quality, nutrient availability, and light availability. Overall, the combined methodology of water sample analysis and satellite data provided a robust and spatially extensive approach for estimating chlorophyll concentrations and understanding chlorophyll dynamics in the study area.
