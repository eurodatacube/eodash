## About the Water Quality: Total Suspended Matter (TSM )Indicator
Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is the mass concentration of organic and inorganic materials suspended in the water column. TSM concentration is higher near the coasts due to the resuspension of terrestrial or submarine particulate matter by tides, waves, and currents. TSM is another proxy for water quality as different contaminants that originate inland, including fertilizers, trace metals, semi-volatile organic compounds, and numerous pesticides, can aggregate to these solids and be brought in suspension. This can alter the state of the aquatic ecosystem and the use of freshwater resources. For instance, excessive suspended material might condition primary productivity and hamper the underwater visibility for fish.

## How is it generated
For the calculation of TSM concentrations follows a study [1] from [CNR-ISMAR](http://www.ismar.cnr.it/), combination of Sentinel-2 [2] and Sentinel-3 [3] data was utilized, and an algorithm was developed to estimate TSM concentrations based on reflectance values from different spectral bands. The algorithm was calibrated and validated using in-situ measurements, and applied to the entire study area to generate spatially continuous maps of TSM concentrations. The satellite-based approach allowed for broad coverage and frequent monitoring, providing a comprehensive assessment of TSM dynamics. The estimated TSM concentrations were compared with other remotely sensed data and environmental variables to understand the factors influencing TSM levels. Overall, the combined methodology provided a robust and spatially extensive approach for estimating TSM concentrations and understanding TSM dynamics in the study area.
