## About the Water Quality: Total Suspended Matter Indicator
Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is the mass concentration of organic and inorganic materials suspended in the water column. TSM concentration is higher near the coasts due to the resuspension of terrestrial or submarine particulate matter by tides, waves, and currents. TSM is another proxy for water quality as different contaminants that originate inland, including fertilizers, trace metals, semi-volatile organic compounds, and numerous pesticides, can aggregate to these solids and be brought in suspension. This can alter the state of the aquatic ecosystem and the use of freshwater resources. For instance, excessive suspended material might condition primary productivity and hamper the underwater visibility for fish.
